                        <p>obesity, low bone mineral density (BMD), and low calcium and vitamin D intake</p>
                <h2 id="1.2.3">The Impact of Environmental Factors on Fractures in Children</h2>
                    <h3>Seasonal and Climatic Differences</h3>
                        <p>Fractures are more common during the summer.</p>
                    <h3>Time of Day</h3>
                    <h3>Home Environment</h3>
                        <p> are mainly caused by falls from furniture, stairs, fences, and trees as well as from injuries
                            sustained from recreational equipment (trampolines and home jungle gyms)</p>
                        <p> In falling from heights, adults often land on their <span class="underline_1">lower extremities</span>,
                            accounting for the high number of lower-extremity fractures, especially the calcaneus.
                            Children tend to fall <span class="underline_1">head first</span>, using the upper extremities to break the fall.This accounts for
                            the larger number of skull and radial fractures in children.</p>
                        <p> In contrast to adults, spinal fractures are rare
                            in children who fall from great heights.<sup>90</sup>&nbsp;In one study, children falling <span class="underline_1">three</span> stories or less all
                            survived.&nbsp;Falls from the fifth or sixth floor resulted in a 50% mortality rate.<sup>6,62,93,102</sup></p>
                    <h3>School Environment</h3>
                        <p>Most injuries occur as a result of use of playground or recreational
                            equipment or participation in athletic activity.</p>

                    <p>Broadly, fractures have three main causes: <span class="underline_1">accidental trauma</span>, <span class="underline_1">nonaccidental trauma (child
                        abuse)</span>, and <span class="underline_1">pathologic conditions</span>.</p>
