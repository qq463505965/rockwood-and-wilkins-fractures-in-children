            <p>A child's bones heal
                <span class="underline_2">quicker</span>, are surrounded by <span class="underline_2">thicker periosteum</span>, and have a substantially <span class="underline_2">greater remodeling
                potential</span> than adults. These differences change the way fractures are treated. In a growing
                child, injury can damage the <span class="underline_2">growth plate</span>, which can be the weakest region of bone.<sup>123</sup> Such
                injury can result in <span class="underline_2">temporary or permanent growth arrest</span>. The growth plate can also remodel
                less than perfect reductions and there can be tremendous remodeling potential.</p>
            <p>Children can have underlying disorders that weaken bone or slow healing, such as
                <span class="underline_2">osteogenesis imperfecta</span>,<sup>82,182</sup> <span class="underline_2">neurofibromatosis</span>,<sup>73</sup> or <span class="underline_2">a bone tumor</span>.<sup>105</sup> The first presentation
                of such conditions may be a referral to an orthopedist for a fracture. For instance, an avulsion fracture,
                such as in the ulna, can be the first presentation for a preteen with osteogenesis
                imperfecta.<sup>149</sup> For these reasons it is critical to understand the normal
                response of a child's bone to trauma to know when there is something unusual in the
                <span class="underline_2">presentation or course of healing</span>, to make these diagnoses.</p>

                <p>Five regions characterize long bones: The bulbous, articular cartilage-covered ends
                    (epiphyses) tapering to the funnel-shaped metaphyses, with the central diaphysis interposed
                    between the metaphyses <span class="figure_num">(Fig. 2-1)</span>.</p>

                <p>The larger long bones (clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna,
                    femur, tibia, and fibula) have physes at both ends, whereas the smaller tubular bones
                    (metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges) usually have a physis at one end only.</p>

                <h2 id="2.2.1">Epiphysis</h2>
                    <p>The <span class="bold">epiphysis</span> is the region of a long bone between the end of the bone and the growth plate
                        (or physis). At birth, the end of the bones is completely cartilaginous (except for the distal
                        femur and occasionally the proximal tibia), and termed as <span class="bold">chondroepiphysis</span>.
                        The appearance of the ossification centers differs between different bones (<span class="figure_num">Figs. 2-3 and 2-4</span>), 
                        and this needs to be taken into account when diagnosing fractures of these
                        regions.<sup class="reference" data-src="2_22.pdf">22</sup><sup style="color:black;">,</sup><sup>136</sup></p>

                    <p>The external surface of the epiphysis is composed of articular cartilage or <b>perichondrium</b>.
                        Muscle fibers, tendons, and ligaments attach to the perichondrium, which also contributes to
                        the centrifugal enlargement of the epiphysis. The perichondrium blends into the periosteum.
                        This perichondrial/periosteal tissue continuity contributes to the biomechanical strength of
                        the epiphyseal/metaphyseal junction at a region that is called the zone of <b>Ranvier</b> (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-
                        5</span>).<sup>42,190</sup> Hyaline cartilage below the articular cartilage contributes to the growth of the
                        epiphysis. As skeletal maturity is reached, a tidemark develops at the demarcation between
                        the articular and calcified epiphyseal hyaline cartilage.</p>

                <h2 id="2.2.2">Physis</h2>
                    <p><span class="umimportant">Physis is a highly organized, yet dynamic structure that consists of chondrocytes undergoing
                        proliferation, differentiation, and formation of complex extracellular matrix. The
                        extracellular matrix is composed of type II collagen fiber network, aggrecans, and
                        noncollagenous proteins, such as cartilage oligomeric protein and matrilin-3. Type IX and XI
                        collagens are minor collagens found in the physis. Type X collagen is also found in the
                        physis; however, its synthesis is limited to the hypertrophic zone and is a distinguishing
                        feature of hypertrophic chondrocyte.</span></p>
                    <p>Understanding of physeal injuries requires knowledge of normal physeal
                        morphology.<sup>179</sup> Histologically, the physis is divided into four zones oriented from the
                        epiphysis to the metaphysis: Germinal (reserve), proliferative, hypertrophic, and provisional
                        calcification (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-5</span>).The proliferative zone is the location of cellular proliferation,
                        whereas the hypertrophic and provisional calcification zones are characterized by
                        extracellular matrix production, cellular hypertrophy, apoptosis, extracellular matrix
                        calcification, and vascular invasion of the lacunae of the terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes.
                        Collagen fiber orientation is horizontal in the germinal zone whereas it is vertical in the
                        proliferative and hypertrophic zones, in line with growth and columnar arrangement of
                        cells.<sup>11</sup> Collagen content is lower in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones compared with
                        the germinal zone. The differences in the collagen content and fiber orientation of different
                        physeal zones have important implications in the mechanical behavior of each zone to
                        mechanical loading.<sup>12</sup> For instance, greater strains are observed in the proliferative and
                        hypertrophic zones compared with the germinal zone following compression loading.
                        The peripheral margin of the physis comprises two specialized areas important to the
                        mechanical integrity and peripheral growth of the physis (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-5</span>). The zone (or groove)
                        of Ranvier is a triangular microscopic structure at the periphery of the physis, containing
                        fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts. It is responsible for peripheral growth of the
                        physis. The perichondral ring of LaCroix is a fibrous structure overlying the zone of Ranvier,
                        connecting the metaphyseal periosteum and cartilaginous epiphysis, and has the important
                        mechanical function of stabilizing the epiphysis to the metaphysis.</p>
                    <p>The epiphysis and secondary ossific nucleus must receive blood supply for viability.<sup>204</sup> Dale
                        and Harris<sup>63</sup> identified two types of blood supply to the epiphysis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-6</span>). <span class="emphasize_2">Type A
                        epiphyses</span> (such as the proximal humeral and proximal femoral epiphyses) are nearly
                        completely covered with articular cartilage; therefore, most of the blood supply to the
                        epiphysis must enter from the perichondrium in a distal to proximal direction. The blood
                        supply to these epiphyses may be easily compromised by epiphyseal separation. A complete
                        disruption of the epiphyseal vasculature, however, may not produce an extensive ischemic
                        damage to the physis if the metaphyseal vasculature is intact.<sup>117</sup> The studies using
                        multiphoton microscopy also suggest that growth plate nutrition is not unidirectional from
                        the epiphysis to the metaphysis as traditionally believed but is contributed by the epiphyseal,
                        metaphyseal, and circumferential perichondrial vasculature.<sup>72,209</sup> <span class="emphasize_2">Type B epiphyses</span> (such as
                        the proximal and distal tibia and the distal radius) have only a portion of their surface
                        covered with articular cartilage and are theoretically less susceptible to devascularization
                        from epiphyseal separation.</p>
                    <img src="./images/Figure 2-6.jpg" style="position:relative;left:50%;transform:translate(-50%)">
                    <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 2-6</span> Classification of epiphyseal blood supply according to Dale and Harris.
                        A: Type A epiphyses are nearly completely covered by articular cartilage. Blood supply must
                        enter via the perichondrium. This blood supply is susceptible to disruption by epiphyseal
                        separation. The proximal femur and proximal humerus are examples of type A
                        epiphyses. B:Type B epiphyses are only partially covered by articular cartilage. Such
                        epiphyses are more resistant to blood supply impairment by epiphyseal separation. The distal
                        femur, proximal and distal tibia, and distal radius are clinical examples of type B epiphyses.</p>
                <h2 id="2.2.3">Metaphysis</h2>
                <p>The <b>metaphysis</b> is the flared portion of the bone at each end of the diaphysis. It has a
                    decreased cortical thickness and increased volume of trabecular bone in the secondary
                    spongiosa. During growth, endochondral modeling centrally and peripherally initially forms
                    the primary spongiosa, which then is remodeled into the more mature secondary spongiosa
                    by osteoclasts and osteoblasts. For this reason, there is considerable bone turnover in the
                    metaphysis compared to other regions of the bone. The metaphyseal cortex is thinner and is
                    more porous than the diaphysis, and there are cortical fenestrations, which contain
                    fibrovascular soft tissue elements that connect the metaphyseal marrow spaces with the
                    subperiosteal region. The metaphyseal region does not develop extensive secondary and
                    tertiary haversian systems until the late stages of skeletal maturation. These microscopic and
                    anatomic changes correlate with changing fracture patterns, and the ability of bone to deform
                    without breaking in this region is why buckle (or torus) fractures are more likely to occur
                    than complete metaphyseal or epiphyseal/physeal fractures.<sup>115,163,205</sup></p>
                <p>Although the periosteum is attached relatively loosely to the diaphysis, it is firmly fixed to
                    the metaphysis because of the increasingly complex continuity of fibrous tissue through the
                    metaphyseal fenestrations. The periosteum subsequently attaches densely into the peripheral
                    physis, blending into the zone of Ranvier as well as the epiphyseal perichondrium. The zone
                    of Ranvier is a specialized region between bone and cartilage formation, and cells in this
                    zone contribute to growth plate remodeling over time.<sup>42,190</sup>The fenestrated metaphyseal
                    cortex extends to the physis as the thin osseous ring of <b>LaCroix</b>. There are no significant
                    direct muscle attachments to the metaphyseal bone; instead, muscle fibers primarily blend
                    into the periosteum. The medial distal femoral attachment of the adductor muscles is a
                    significant exception.</p>
                    <h3>Growth Lines of Park and Harris</h3>
                        <p>Many bones exhibit transversely oriented, dense trabecular linear bone patterns within the
                            metaphysis. These lines duplicate the contiguous physeal contour, and appear after processes
                            which transiently slow growth or increase mineralization. As such, they are seen after
                            generalized illnesses, treatment with bisphosphonate drugs (which inhibit osteoclasts, and
                            therefore decrease bone resorption and remodeling of the primary spongiosa), or after
                            localized processes within the bone, such as infection or growth plate trauma. <span class="emphasize_1">The lines are
                            called Harris or Park growth slowdown or arrest lines</span>. Once the normal longitudinal growth
                            rate resumes, longitudinal trabecular<sup>8</sup> orientation is restored. The thickened, transversely
                            oriented osseous plate is left behind, will be gradually remodeled, and with time will
                            disappear (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-7</span>).<sup class="reference" data-src="2_193.pdf">193</sup></p>

                            months later.</p>
                        <p>In a systemic problem slowing bone growth, the lines are distributed relatively symmetrically
                            throughout the skeleton, and are thickest in metaphyses from bones that grow most rapidly.
                            The lines are important in analyzing the effects of a fracture on growth. They can be
                            measured and the sides compared to corroborate femoral overgrowth after diaphyseal
                            fracture and eccentric overgrowth medially after proximal tibial metaphyseal fracture. A line
                            that converges toward a physis suggests localized growth damage that may result in an

                <h2 id="2.2.4">Diaphysis</h2>
                    <p>The diaphysis constitutes the major portion of each long bone, and is formed from bone
                        remodeled from the metaphysis. Mature, lamellar bone is the dominant feature of the
                        diaphyseal bone, and the developing diaphyseal bone is extremely vascular. When analyzed
                        in cross section, the center is much less dense than the maturing bone of older children,
                        adolescents, and adults. Subsequent growth leads to increased complexity of the haversian
                        (osteonal) systems and the formation of increasing amounts of extracellular matrix, causing a
                        relative decrease in cross-sectional porosity and an increase in hardness. Some bones, such as
                        the tibia, exhibit a decrease in vascularity as the bone matures; this factor affects the rate of
                        healing and risk of nonunion.<sup>40,162</sup> The vascularity of bone is important not only because it
                        brings nutrients to the bone, but also because pericyte cells surrounding blood vessels
                        contribute to new osteoblasts.<sup>19</sup></p>
                <h2 id="2.2.5">Periosteum</h2>
                    <p>A child's periosteum is thicker and more readily elevated from the bone than in adults. It also
                        has a much greater osteogenic potential than that of an adult. Indeed, in young children, one
                        can remove the entire diaphysis of a bone, but leave the periosteum, and the bone will
                        regrow. The thicker and stronger periosteum affects fracture displacement, ease of closed
                        reduction, and the capacity to form new bone. The periosteum usually remains intact on the
                        concave (compression) side of an injury. This intact periosteal hinge or sleeve may lessen the
                        extent of displacement of the fracture fragments, and it also can be used to assist in the
                        reduction, because the intact portion contributes to the intrinsic stability. Thus, accentuating
                        the deformity, unlocks the periosteum, helping with the reduction. Because the periosteum
                        allows tissue continuity across the fracture, the subperiosteal new bone that forms quickly
                        bridges the fracture gap and leads to more rapid long-term stability.<sup>10,20</sup></p>
                    <p>The periosteum comprises two tissue layers. An outer fibroblast layer provides fibrous
                        attachment to subcutaneous connective tissue, muscles, tendons, and ligaments, whereas the
                        inner cambium layer contains a pool of cells that support bone formation and repair. The
                        periosteum, rather than the bone itself, serves as the origin for muscle fibers along the
                        metaphysis and diaphysis. This mechanism allows coordinated growth of bone and muscle
                        units; something that would be impossible if all the muscle tissues attached directly to the
                        developing bone or cartilage. Exceptions include the attachment of muscle fibers near the
                        linea aspera and into the medial distal femoral metaphysis. The latter pattern of direct
                        metaphyseal osseous attachment may be associated with significant irregularity of cortical
                        and trabecular bones. Radiographs of this area often are misinterpreted as showing a
                        neoplastic, osteomyelitic, or traumatic response, even though this is actually a variation of
                        skeletal development. The periosteum in the growing child also plays a critical role in
                        remodeling, as the tissues in tension over the concave side of a deformity will produce new
                        bone. The bone on the tension, or convex, side of a deformity will be resorbed over time,
                        ultimately resulting in a straight diaphysis.<sup>10,20,106</sup></p>
                <h2 id="2.2.6">Apophysis</h2>
                    <p>An apophysis is composed of fibrocartilage instead of columnar cartilage and grows
                        primarily in response to tensile forces. They are generally attached to muscular structures.
                        With growth secondary ossification centers can form in the apophysis. Because of the
                        differing histologic composition of these structures, they fail differently than other parts of
                        the bone, and excessive tensile stress may avulse the apophysis, especially during the late
                        stages of closure. Such injuries can generate large amounts of new bone, and may be
                        mistaken for tumors, especially around the pelvis. Healing of a displaced fragment to the
                        underlying undisplaced secondary center creates the symptomatic reactive overgrowth, and
                        in the tibial tuberosity apophysis, this is known as an <b>Osgood-Schlatter lesion</b>.<sup>64,140,181</sup></p>
            <h1 id="2.3">Mechanisms of Fracture Healing</h1>
                <p>Fracture healing is a complex regenerative process initiated in response to injury, in which
                    bone can heal by primary or secondary mechanisms. In primary healing, new bone is laid
                    down without any intermediate. This type of healing is rare in a complete bone fracture,
                    except when the fracture is rigidly fixed through certain types of surgery. In the more
                    common secondary healing, immature and disorganized bone forms between the fragments,
                    which is termed the callus.<sup>45,70,142,164</sup> During the fracture repair process, cells progress
                    through stages of differentiation reminiscent of those that cells progress through during
                    normal fetal bone development. In normal development of long bone, undifferentiated
                    mesenchymal cells initially form a template of the bone, which differentiate to chondrocytes.
                    This cartilaginous template is termed the bone's anlage. Following this phase, blood vessels
                    enter the cartilaginous template, and osteoblasts, which differentiate from perivascular and
                    other cells surrounding the bone, form bone.</p>
                <p>There are, however, several important differences between <span class="emphasize_1">bone repair</span> and <span class="emphasize_1">development</span>.
                    One is that repair does not need to progress through a cartilaginous template. Another is that
                    the liberation of growth factors in the extracellular environment and inflammatory mediators
                    initiates fracture repair, and the activation of these factors does not occur during
                    development. Indeed, this inflammatory initiation of repair processes may be the
                    fundamental difference between development and regeneration. This is one reason that
                    agents that modulate inflammation can affect bone formation. Although some inflammatory
                    pathways can have both positive and negative effects on bone repair, an inhibition of
                    prostaglandin activity inhibits bone formation, and indeed this has been used clinically to
                    prevent bone formation.<sup>29,151,177</sup></p>
                <p>Osseous repair progresses through closely integrated phases. In the initial phase of fracture
                    repair, bleeding from the damaged tissues causes a hematoma at the fracture site, stopping
                    blood loss and liberating growth factors and cytokines. Endothelial cells respond by
                    increasing their vascular permeability, allowing leukocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and
                    multipotential mesenchymal cells to reach the fracture site.<sup>159</sup> The blood supply is
                    temporarily disrupted for a few millimeters on either side of the fracture site, producing local
                    necrosis and hypoxia. In the proliferative phase, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells
                    aggregate at the site of injury, proliferate, and differentiate presumably in response to growth
                    factors produced by the injured tissues.<sup>45</sup> This process involves both intramembranous and
                    endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone
                    directly from committed osteoprogenitor cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that
                    reside in the periosteum, resulting in hard callus formation.<sup>68</sup> During endochondral
                    ossification, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, producing cartilaginous
                    matrix, which then undergoes calcification and eventually is replaced by bone. The formation
                    of primary bone is followed by extensive remodeling until the damaged skeletal element
                    regains its original shape and size (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-9</span>).<sup>68,70,142</sup></p>
                <img src="./images/Figure 2-9.jpg" style="position:relative;left:50%;transform:translate(-50%)">
                <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 2-9</span> Phases of fracture repair.
                    The figure demonstrates the three phases of fracture repair: (A) inflammatory phase, (B)
                    reparative phase, and (C) remodeling phase. The inflammatory cells remove the debris from
                    the fracture site and, together with the fibroblastic cells, develop the site into a matrix that
                    will support the cells that enable new bone to be formed. The mesenchymal cells are
                    recruited by the release of growth factors in the fracture site. The mesenchymal cells may
                    differentiate into osteoblasts that produce bone in a membranous fashion. Alternately the
                    mesenchymal cell may become chondrogenic and produce bone by the endochondral
                    pathway. Remodeling begins with resorption of mechanically unnecessary, inefficient
                    portions of the callus and the subsequent orientation of trabecular bone along the lines of
                    stress.</p>
                <p>The strength of bone is a function of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the ossified tissue
                    as well as the way the tissue is organized. When a child's fracture heals, the weaker callous
                    has a larger diameter than the intact bone, but because the weaker material is farther from the
                    center, the moment of inertia is increased, and as a whole unit the bone can be just as strong
                    as if it had not fractured. Children form a larger diameter callous than adults, in part because
                    the stronger periosteum comes off the bone easier and forms a wider barrier to the callous. In
                    addition, during the proliferative phase of fracture repair, children form new bone faster than
                    adults. These factors combine to make children's bone regain its strength much quicker
                    following a fracture than an adult. Furthermore, these factors are responsible for the
                    observation that the younger the child the quicker a fractured bone will regain its strength.
                    Several cell signaling pathways are normally activated during fracture repair, and many of
                    these are the same ones that are activated during bone development. Certain BMPs are
                    liberated early in the repair process, and they stimulate undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to
                    achieve an osteoblastic phenotype. Tibial fractures are a high-risk injury for developing a
                    nonunion and clinical studies show that treatment with select BMPs will improve the rate of
                    healing in this situation.<sup>85</sup> Another pathway that plays an important role in bone repair is β-
                    catenin. There is upregulation of β-catenin during the healing process,<sup>21,55,56</sup> and healing is
                    repressed in mice lacking β-catenin. However, β-catenin functions differently at different
                    stages of fracture repair. Because drugs that modulate β-catenin are in development, this is an
                    area in which novel therapies could be used to improve delayed repair.<sup>55,58,198</sup>
                    The various signaling pathways which play a role in bone repair also interact with each other
                    during the repair process. For instance, the inflammatory process activates prostaglandin
                    synthesis, which regulates BMP expression in mesenchymal progenitors.<sup>18</sup> In a similar
                    manner, prostaglandin activity also regulates β-catenin activity.<sup>118</sup>Furthermore, BMP
                    stimulation requires β-catenin to produce bone.<sup>56</sup> Thus, the various signaling pathways
                    involved in bone repair and regeneration do not act alone but in a coordinated manner to
                    allow for bone regeneration.</p>

                <h2 id="2.4.1">Remodeling of Bones After a Fracture in Children</h2>
                    <p>In a growing child, the normal process of bone growth and remodeling may realign initially
                        malunited fragments, making anatomic reduction less important than in an adult. Bone and
                        cartilage generally remodel in response to normal stresses of body weight, muscle action, and
                        joint reaction forces, as well as intrinsic control mechanisms such as the periosteum. The
                        potential for spontaneous, complete correction is greater if the child is younger, the fracture
                        site is closer to the physis, and there is relative alignment of the angulation in the normal
                        plane of motion of the joint (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-10</span>).<sup>201</sup> This is particularly evident in fractures involving
                        hinge joints such as the knee, ankle, elbow, or wrist, in which corrections are relatively rapid
                        if the angulation is in the normal plane of motion. As an example, the distal radius can
                        correct deformities at a rate of one degree a month.<sup>80,97,131</sup> However, spontaneous correction
                        of angular deformities is unlikely in other directions, such as a cubitus varus deformity
                        following a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Similarly, rotational deformities usually
                        do not correct spontaneously.<sup>163,184</sup></p>

                        open growth plate, and as such is a unique feature of childhood injury.</p>
                <h2 id="2.4.2">Growth Stimulation</h2>
                    <p>Fractures may stimulate longitudinal growth by increasing the blood supply to the
                        metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis, and at least on an experimental basis, by disrupting the
                        periosteum and its physiologic restraint on the rates of longitudinal growth of the physes.
                        Such increased growth may make the bone longer than it would have been without an injury.
                        Eccentric overgrowth may also occur; this is particularly evident in tibia valgum following
                        an incomplete fracture of the proximal tibial metaphysis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-11</span>).<sup>201</sup></p>

                        <p>Physes can be injured in many ways, both obvious and subtle. Obviously, the most frequent
                            mechanism of injury is fracture. Most commonly, physeal injury is direct, with a fracture
                            involving the physis itself. Occasionally, physeal injury from trauma is associated with a
                            fracture elsewhere in the limb segment, either as a result of ischemia<sup>167</sup> or perhaps
                            compression<sup>1,13,33,103,143,150,206</sup> (see discussion of Salter-Harris type V physeal fractures
                            below). Other mechanisms of injuries to the physes include infection<sup>26,31,126,165</sup>; disruption by
                            tumor, cysts,<sup>199</sup> and tumor-like disorders; vascular insult<sup>167</sup>; repetitive stress<sup>9,34,49,50,134,213</sup>;

                            with the first written account of this injury. Poland reviewed accounts of physeal injuries in
                            his 1898 book, <i>Traumatic Separation of the Epiphysis</i>,<sup>174</sup> and is credited with the first
                            classification of the patterns of physeal fracture. Modifications to Poland's original scheme
                            have been proposed by a number of authors,<sup>23,45,63,66,137,153,155,168,169,172,185</sup> including
                            Aitken,<sup>4</sup> Salter and Harris,<sup data-src="2_185.pdf" class="reference">185</sup> Ogden et al.,<sup>143,155</sup> and Peterson.<sup>168,169</sup> Classifications of physeal
                            fractures are important because they alert the practitioner to potentially subtle radiographic
                            fracture patterns, can be of prognostic significance with respect to growth disturbance
                            potential, and guide general treatment principles based on that risk and associated joint
                            disruption. Currently, the <b>Salter-Harris</b> classification, first published in 1963,<sup data-src="2_185.pdf" class="reference">185</sup> is firmly
                            entrenched in the literature and most orthopedists' minds. The reader also should be aware of
                            some deficiencies in that classification, as pointed out by Peterson and discussed
                            below.<sup>168,169,170</sup></p>
                        <h4>Salter-Harris Classification of Physeal Fractures</h4>
                            <p><b>Salter-Harris</b> Classification consists of five types of physeal injuries.<sup data-src="2_185.pdf" class="reference">185</sup> The first four types
                                were adopted from Poland (types I, II, and III) and Aitken (Aitken type III became Salter-
                                Harris type IV) (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-14</span>). Salter and Harris added a fifth type, which they postulated was
                                an unrecognized compression injury characterized by normal radiographs and late physeal
                                closure.<sup>1,13,24,33,99,103,116,170,206</sup></p>

                                In Salter-Harris type I fractures, the fracture line is entirely within the physis, referred to by
                                Poland as type I. In Salter-Harris type II fractures, the fracture line extends from the physis
                                into the metaphysis; described by Poland as type II and Aitken as type I. In Salter-Harris
                                type III fractures, the fracture enters the epiphysis from the physis and almost always exits
                                the articular surface. Poland described this injury as type III and Aitken as type II. In Salter-
                                Harris type IV, the fracture extends across the physis from the articular surface and
                                epiphysis, to exit in the margin of the metaphysis. Aitken described this as a type III injury in
                                his classification. Salter-Harris type V fractures were described by Salter and Harris as a
                                crush injury to the physis with initially normal radiographs with late identification of
                                premature physeal closure.</p>
                            <h5>Type I</h5>
                                <p><span class="underline_1">Salter-Harris type I injuries are characterized by a transphyseal plane of injury, with no bony
                                    fracture line through either the metaphysis or the epiphysis</span>. Radiographs of undisplaced type
                                    I physeal fractures, therefore, are normal except for associated soft tissue swelling, making
                                    careful patient examination particularly important in this injury. In the Olmstead County
                                    Survey of physeal fractures,<sup>171</sup> type I fractures occurred most frequently in the phalanges,
                                    metacarpals, distal tibia, and distal ulna. Epiphyseal separations in infants occur most
                                    commonly in the proximal humerus, distal humerus, and proximal femur. If there is an
                                    urgency to make the diagnosis on patients suspected of having a type I injury, further
                                    imaging by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),<sup>46,60,108,172,196</sup> or intraoperative
                                    arthrography may be helpful.<sup>6,89,139</sup> Ultrasound is particularly helpful for assessing epiphyseal
                                    separations in infants (especially in the proximal femur and elbow regions) without the need
                                    for sedation, anesthetic, or invasive procedure.<sup>37,66,67,98,188</sup></p>

                                    Because the hypertrophic zone is the weakest zone structurally, separation should occur at
                                    this level. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed that the fracture plane is more
                                    complex than this concept and frequently involves other physeal zones as well.</p>
                                <p>Because the articular surface and, at least in theory, the germinal and proliferative layers of
                                    the physis are not displaced, the general principles of fracture management are to secure a
                                    gentle and adequate reduction of the epiphysis on the metaphysis and stabilize the fragments
                                    as needed.</p>
                            <h5>Type II</h5>
                                <p>Type II injuries have physeal and metaphyseal components; the fracture line extends from
                                    the physeal margin peripherally across a variable portion of the physis and exits into the
                                    metaphysis at the opposite end of the fracture (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-16</span>). The epiphyseal fragment thus
                                    comprises all of the epiphysis and some portion of the peripheral metaphysis (the Thurston
                                    Holland fragment or sign). The physeal portion of this fracture has microscopic
                                    characteristics similar to those of type I injuries, but the fracture line exits the physis to enter
                                    the metaphysis (i.e., away from the germinal and proliferative layers) at one margin. Similar
                                    to type I injuries, these fractures should have a limited propensity to subsequent growth
                                    disturbance as a consequence of direct physeal injury. However, the metaphyseal “spike” of
                                    the diaphyseal/metaphyseal fragment may be driven into the physis of the epiphyseal
                                    fragment, which can damage the physis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-17</span>). Similar to type I injuries, the articular
                                    surface is not affected and the general principles of fracture management are effectively the
                                    same.</p>

                                    the epiphyseal fragment (with the physis) by the dorsal margin of the proximal fragment

                            <h5>Type III</h5>
                                <p>Salter-Harris type III fractures begin in the epiphysis (with only rare exception) as a fracture
                                    through the articular surface and extend vertically toward the physis. The fracture then
                                    courses peripherally through the physis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-18</span>). There are two fracture fragments: a small
                                    fragment consisting of a portion of the epiphysis and physis, and a large fragment consisting
                                    the remaining epiphysis and long bone. This fracture pattern is important for two main
                                    reasons: the articular surface is involved and the fracture line involves the germinal and
                                    proliferative layers of the physis. In addition, type III injuries are often associated with highenergy
                                    or compression mechanisms of injury, which imply greater potential disruption of the
                                    physis and higher risk of subsequent growth disturbance. Anatomic reduction (usually open)
                                    and stabilization are required to restore the articular surface and to minimize the potential for
                                    growth disturbance (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-19</span>).</p>

                            <h5>Type IV</h5>
                                <p>Type IV fractures are effectively vertical shear fractures, extending from the articular surface
                                    to the metaphysis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-20A</span>). These fractures are important because they disrupt the
                                    articular surface, violate all the physeal layers in crossing from the epiphysis to the
                                    metaphysis, and, with displacement, may result in metaphyseal-epiphyseal cross union (<span class="figure_num">Fig.
                                    2-20B</span>).<sup>51,84</sup> The latter occurrence almost invariably results in subsequent growth disturbance.
                                    This fracture pattern is frequent around the medial malleolus, but may occur in other
                                    epiphyses. Lateral condylar fractures of the distal humerus and intra-articular two-part
                                    triplane fractures of the distal tibia may be thought of as complex Salter-Harris type IV
                                    fractures.</p>

                            <h5>Type V</h5>
                                <p>The type V fracture described by Salter and Harris was not described by Poland or Aitken.
                                    Salter and Harris postulated that type V fractures represented unrecognized compression
                                    injuries with normal initial radiographs that later produced premature physeal closure. The
                                    existence of true type V injuries was questioned by Peterson and Burkhart<sup>170</sup> and
                                    subsequently became a subject of debate.<sup>1,13,24,33,99,103,116,206</sup> We believe that delayed physeal
                                    closure clearly occurs. The most common example of such an injury is closure of the tibial
                                    tubercle, often with the development of recurvatum deformity of the proximal tibia, after
                                    fractures of the femur or distal femoral epiphysis.<sup>33,99,103</sup> Although the mechanism of such
                                    injuries may be unclear (perhaps vascular rather than compression trauma), the traditionally
                                    held view that such injuries occurred as a result of inadvertent direct injury during the
                                    insertion of proximal tibial skeletal traction pins has been unequivocally discounted in some
                                    cases.33,99,103 By definition, this pattern of injury is unrecognized on initial radiographs.
                                    Undoubtedly, more sophisticated imaging of injured extremities (such as with MRI) will
                                    identify physeal injuries in the presence of normal plain radiographs (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-21</span>). Although
                                    the mechanism of injury in type V injuries may be in dispute, in our opinion, the existence of
                                    such injuries is not.</p>

                        <p>In general, fractures in children, including physeal injuries, heal more rapidly than in adults,
                            and they are less likely to experience morbidity or mortality from prolonged immobilization.
                            In addition, children are also often less compliant with postoperative activity restrictions,
                            making cast immobilization a frequently necessary adjunct to therapy.
                            Physeal fractures, like all fractures, should be managed in a consistent methodical manner
                            that includes a general assessment and stabilization of the polytraumatized patient, and
                            evaluation of the neurovascular and soft tissue status of the traumatized limb; what
                            constitutes an “acceptable” reduction is dictated in part by the fracture pattern and
                            remodeling potential of the fracture. Intra-articular fractures (such as Salter-Harris types III
                            and IV) require anatomic reduction to restore the articular surface and prevent epiphyseal-
                            metaphyseal cross union. Salter-Harris type I and II fractures, particularly those that are the
                            result of low-energy injuries, have minimal risk of growth disturbance (except injuries of the
                            distal femur and proximal tibia) and excellent remodeling potential in most patients; in such
                            patients, the surgeon must be cautious not to create physeal injury by excessive force or
                            invasive reductions. When performing a closed reduction of physeal fractures the aphorism
                            “90% traction, 10% translation” is useful to minimize iatrogenic injury to the physis which
                            may occur as a physis grinds against a sharp bony metaphysis.</p>
                    <h3 id="2.4.3.6">Complications of Physeal Fractures</h3>
                        <p>Except for the possibility of subsequent growth disturbance, the potential complications of
                            physeal injuries are no different than other traumatic musculoskeletal injuries. Neurovascular
                            compromise and compartment syndrome represent the most serious potential
                            complications.<sup>36,160</sup> Infection and soft tissue loss can complicate physeal fracture
                            management, just as they can in other fractures. <span class="emphasize_1">The one complication unique to physeal
                            injuries is growth disturbance</span>. Most commonly, this “disturbance” is the result of a tethering
                            (physeal bar or arrest) that may produce angular deformity or shortening. However, growth
                            disturbance may occur without an obvious tether or bar and growth acceleration also occurs
                            (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-25</span>). Finally, growth disturbance may occur without recognized injury to the physis.</p>

                            distance between the screws on either side of the physis has increased asymmetrically,
                            confirming asymmetric growth rather than cessation of growth laterally. C: The angular

                        <h4>Physeal Growth Disturbance</h4>
                            <p>An uncommon but important complication of physeal fracture is physeal growth
                                disturbance.<sup>141,150,178</sup> The potential consequences of physeal growth disturbance include the
                                development of <span class="emphasize_1">angular deformity, limb-length inequality, epiphyseal distortion, or various
                                combinations of these</span>. Development of these abnormalities, if any, depends on the physis
                                affected, location within the affected physis, the duration of time present, and the skeletal
                                maturity of the patient. Frequently, further surgery, often repeated and extensive, is required
                                to correct or prevent deformity caused by an established growth
                                disturbance.<sup>35,38,91,113,124,128,186,210</sup></p>
                            <h5>Etiology</h5>
                                <p>Disturbance of normal physeal growth may result from physical loss of the physis (such as
                                    after Peterson type VI injuries), from disruption of normal physeal architecture and function
                                    without actual radiographic loss of the physis, or by the formation of a physeal arrest, also
                                    called bony bridges or physeal bars.<sup>207</sup></p>
                                <p>Growth disturbance as a result of physeal injury may result from direct trauma (physeal
                                    fracture)<sup>141,150,178</sup> or associated vascular disruption.<sup>167</sup> Infection,<sup>26,31</sup>destruction by a spaceoccupying
                                    lesion such as unicameral bone cyst or enchondroma,199 infantile Blount
                                    disease,<sup>25</sup> other vascular disturbances (such as purpura
                                    fulminans),<sup>17,87,107,122</sup> irradiation,<sup>24,180</sup> and other rare causes<sup>27,39,48</sup> also may result in physeal
                                    growth disturbance or physeal arrest.</p>
                            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
                                <p>Physeal growth disturbance may present as a radiographic abnormality noted on serial
                                    radiographs in a patient known to be at risk after fracture or infection, clinically with
                                    established limb deformity (angular deformity, shortening, or both), or occasionally
                                    incidentally on radiographs obtained for other reasons. The hallmark of plain radiographic
                                    features of physeal growth disturbance is the loss of normal physeal contour and the sharply
                                    defined radiolucency between epiphyseal and metaphyseal bones. Frank physeal arrests
                                    typically are characterized by sclerosis in the region of the arrest. If asymmetric growth has
                                    occurred, there may be tapering of a growth arrest line to the area of arrest,<sup>90,154</sup> angular
                                    deformity, epiphyseal distortion, or shortening (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-8</span>). Physeal growth disturbance
                                    without frank arrest typically appears on plain radiographs as a thinner or thicker physeal
                                    area with an indistinct metaphyseal border because of alteration in normal endochondral
                                    ossification. There may be an asymmetric growth arrest line indicating angular deformity,
                                    but the arrest line will not taper to the physis itself.<sup>154</sup> This indicates altered physeal growth
                                    (either asymmetric acceleration or deceleration) but not a complete cessation of growth. This
                                    distinction is important, because the consequences and treatment are different from those
                                    caused by complete growth arrest.</p>
                                <p>If a growth arrest is suspected on plain radiographs in a skeletally immature child, further
                                    evaluation is often warranted. CT scanning with sagittal and coronal reconstructions
                                    (orthogonal to the area of interest) may demonstrate clearly an area of bone bridging the
                                    physis between the epiphysis and the metaphysis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-26</span>). MRI is also a sensitive method
                                    of assessing physeal architecture.<sup>46,69,81</sup> Revealing images of the physis and the region of
                                    physeal growth disturbance can be obtained using three-dimensional (3D) spoiled recalled
                                    gradient-echo images with fat saturation or fast spin-echo proton density images with fat
                                    saturation (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-27</span>). MRI has the additional capability to assess the organization of the
                                    residual physis that may indicate its relative “health.” This assessment may be helpful in
                                    cases of infection, irradiation, or tumor to determine if arrest resection is feasible based on
                                    the integrity of the remaining physis.</p>

                                    3D SPGR MR images with fat suppression (B, C) of the ankle show two areas of bridging
                                    (arrows) across the growth plate on the coronal and sagittal views. These bridges are higher
                                    signal than the epiphyseal or metaphyseal bone and therefore may represent fibrous physeal
                                    bars. Corresponding coronal (D) and sagittal (E) CT reformations show narrowing of growth

                                    created by manually outlining the growth plate in the 3D SPGR sequence; a central U-shaped
                                    physeal bar with two free limbs is seen. Surface area occupied by the bar can then be
                                    calculated for treatment planning.

                                <p>Although definitive assessment of physeal growth disturbance or arrest may require
                                    advanced imaging, further evaluation by plain radiographs is also beneficial. Radiographs of
                                    the entire affected limb should be obtained to document the magnitude of angular deformity.
                                    Existing limb-length inequality should be assessed by scanogram. Use of EOS low-dose
                                    biplanar radiographic imaging system is appealing for this purpose as it provides more
                                    accurate assessment of limb length than conventional radiographs and is associated with
                                    significantly lower dose of radiation.<sup>71</sup> An estimation of predicted growth remaining in the
                                    contralateral unaffected physis should be made based on a determination of the child's
                                    skeletal age and reference to an appropriate growth table.<sup>14,15,16,86,94,95,138</sup></p>
                        <h4>Growth Disturbance Without Arrest</h4>
                            <h5>Recognition</h5>
                                <p>Growth disturbance may also occur without physeal arrest. Both growth deceleration and,
                                    less frequently, acceleration have been reported. Growth deceleration without arrest is
                                    characterized radiographically by the appearance of an injured physis (usually relative
                                    widening of the physis with indistinct metaphyseal boundaries). There may be associated
                                    clinical or radiographic deformity if the disturbance is severe and long standing. It is
                                    important to make a distinction between growth deceleration without complete cessation and
                                    true physeal arrest, because management and outcome are typically different in these two
                                    disorders. The concept of growth deceleration without arrest is most readily appreciated in
                                    patients with adolescent Blount disease and milder stages of infantile Blount disease.
                                    Recently, growth deceleration without physeal arrest has also been reported to produce distal
                                    femoral valgus deformity in obese adolescents.<sup>195</sup> Growth deceleration may also occur after
                                    infection and physeal fracture. In contrast to physeal arrests, there is no sclerotic area of
                                    arrest on plain radiographs (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-25</span>). A growth arrest line, if present, may be
                                    asymmetric but will not taper to the physis, thereby suggesting growth asymmetry but not
                                    complete arrest. Furthermore, in some cases, deformity will not be relentlessly progressive
                                    and can actually improve over time.</p>
                                <p>Growth acceleration most classically occurs following proximal tibial fracture in young
                                    patients resulting in valgus deformity which usually spontaneously resolves.<sup>104,111,156,194,195,214</sup></p>
                            <h5>Management</h5>
                                <p>Once a growth disturbance has been identified in a patient, its full impact should be assessed
                                    by determining the presence and extent of limb-length inequality and the calculated amount
                                    of potential growth remaining for the affected physis.</p>
                                <p>In some cases, the radiographic abnormality is stable and only longitudinal observation is
                                    required. This observation must be regular and careful, because progressive deformity will
                                    require treatment. If angular deformity is present or progressive, treatment options include
                                    hemiepiphysiodesis or physeal “tethering” with staples, screws, or tension
                                    plates<sup>32,52,74,78,144,145,152,192,200,208</sup> and corrective osteotomy, with or without completion of the
                                    epiphysiodesis. In the absence of frank arrest formation, hemiepiphysiodesis or “tethering”
                                    the affected physis with staples, screws, or tension plates on the convex side may result in
                                    gradual correction of the deformity. If correction occurs, options include completion of the
                                    epiphysiodesis (with contralateral epiphysiodesis if necessary to prevent the development of
                                    significant limb-length deformity) and removal of the tethering device with careful
                                    longitudinal observation for recurrence or overcorrection of deformity. Although there have
                                    been numerous publications regarding the various techniques and implants for physeal
                                    tethering, there is to date no solid evidence to support one technique. One pitfall to avoid is
                                    that a “tethering” technique (staples, plate, screw) opposite a known partial physeal arrest is
                                    unlikely to lead to correction of angular deformity, and is likely to lead to a complete growth
                                    arrest.</p>
                                <p>Corrective osteotomy is the other option for the management of growth disturbance with
                                    established angular deformity. The treating surgeon must decide whether to perform
                                    epiphysiodesis of the affected physis (with contralateral epiphysiodesis, if appropriate) to
                                    prevent recurrence or to ensure careful longitudinal observation of the growth performance
                                    of the affected physis until skeletal maturity.</p>
                <h2 id="2.4.4">Physeal Arrests</h2>
                    <p>Whenever a bridge of bone develops across a portion of the physis, tethering of the
                        metaphyseal and epiphyseal bone together may result. Partial physeal arrests can result in
                        angular deformity, joint distortion, limb-length inequality, or combinations of these,
                        depending on the location of the arrest, the rate and extent of growth remaining in the physis
                        involved, and the health of the residual affected physis.</p>
                    <h3>Classification</h3>
                    <p>Partial physeal arrests can be classified by etiology and anatomic pattern. Potential etiologies
                        of physeal arrest include physeal fracture, Blount disease, infection, tumor, frostbite, and
                        irradiation. Physeal arrests also can be classified based on the anatomic relationship of the
                        arrest to the residual “healthy” physis. Three basic patterns are recognized (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-28</span>):
                        central, peripheral, and linear. A central arrest is surrounded by a perimeter of normal physis,
                        like an island within the remaining physis. Central arrests are most likely to cause tenting of
                        the articular surface, but also may result in angular deformity, if eccentrically located, and
                        limb-length inequality (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-29</span>). A peripheral arrest is located at the perimeter of the
                        affected physis. This type of arrest primarily causes progressive angular deformity and
                        variable shortening. A linear arrest is a “through-and-through” lesion with anatomic
                        characteristics of both central and peripheral arrests; specifically, the affected area starts at
                        the perimeter of the physis and extends centrally with normal physis on either side of the
                        affected area. Linear arrests most commonly develop after Salter-Harris type III or IV
                        physeal fractures of the medial malleolus.</p>

                            Central arrests are surrounded by a perimeter of normal physis. Peripheral arrests are located
                            at the perimeter of the physis. Linear arrests are “through-and-through” lesions with normal
                            physis on either side of the arrest area.</p>

                        <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 2-29</span> Central arrests are characterized by tenting of the articular surface.
                            Variable shortening and angular deformity will develop, depending on the size and location
                            of the arrest.</p>
                    <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>Several management alternatives are available. It is important to be aware of these and to
                            weigh carefully the appropriateness of each for the individual situation.</p>
                        <h4>Prevention of Arrest Formation</h4>
                            <p>Ideally, the surgeon should be proactive in the prevention of physeal arrest formation. Most
                                commonly, this can be accomplished by adhering to the general treatment principles of
                                physeal fractures: gentle, anatomic, and secure reduction of the fracture, especially Salter–
                                Harris type III and IV injuries.</p>
                        <h4>Physeal Distraction</h4>
                            <p>Physeal arrests have been treated with the application of an external fixator spanning the
                                arrest and gradual distraction until the arrest “separates.”<sup>44,61</sup> Angular deformity correction
                                and lengthening can be accomplished after separation as well. However, distraction injury
                                usually results in complete cessation of subsequent normal physeal growth at the distracted
                                level.<sup>75</sup> Furthermore, the fixation wires or half pins may have tenuous fixation in the
                                epiphysis or violate the articular space, risking septic arthritis. Thus, this modality is rarely
                                used.</p>
                        <h4>Repeated Osteotomies During Growth</h4>
                            <p>The simplest method to correct angular deformity associated with physeal arrests is
                                corrective osteotomy in the adjacent metaphysis. Of course, neither significant limb-length
                                inequality nor epiphyseal distortion that may result from the arrest is corrected by this
                                strategy. However, in young patients with a great deal of growth remaining in whom
                                previous physeal arrest resection has been unsuccessful or is technically not possible, this
                                treatment may be a reasonable interim alternative until more definitive completion of arrest
                                and management of limb-length inequality is feasible.</p>
                        <h4>Completion of Epiphysiodesis and Management of Resulting Limb-Length Discrepancy</h4>
                            <p>An alternative strategy for the management of physeal arrests is to complete the
                                epiphysiodesis to prevent recurrent angular deformity or epiphyseal distortion and manage
                                the existing or potential limb-length discrepancy appropriately. Management of the latter
                                may be by simultaneous or subsequent lengthening of the affected limb segment or
                                contralateral epiphysiodesis if the existing discrepancy is tolerable and lengthening is not
                                desired. We believe that this course of management is specifically indicated if arrest
                                resection has failed to result in restoration of longitudinal growth and in patients in whom the
                                amount of growth remaining does not warrant an attempt at arrest resection. In our opinion,
                                this treatment should be considered carefully in all patients with a physeal arrest.</p>
                        <h4>Partial Physeal Arrest Resection</h4>
                            <p>Conceptually, surgical resection of a physeal arrest (sometimes referred to
                                as physiolysis or epiphysiolysis) restoring normal growth of the affected physis is the ideal
                                treatment for this condition.<sup>35,38,51,79,113,125,127,128,141,158,209</sup> The principle is to remove the bony
                                tether between the metaphysis and the physis and fill the physeal defect with a bone
                                reformation retardant, anticipating that the residual healthy physis will resume normal
                                longitudinal growth.<sup>35,79,124,127,128,158</sup> However, this procedure can be technically demanding,
                                and results in our practice are modest. To determine if this procedure is indicated, careful
                                consideration must be given to the etiology, location, and extent of the arrest and the amount
                                of longitudinal growth to be potentially salvaged.</p>
                    <h3>Etiology of the Arrest</h3>
                        <p>Arrests caused by trauma or infantile Blount disease have a better prognosis for resumption
                            of normal growth, compared with those secondary to infection, tumor (or tumor-like
                            conditions), or irradiation.</p>
                    <h3>Anatomic Type of the Arrest</h3>
                        <p>Central and linear arrests have been reported to be more likely to demonstrate resumption of
                            growth after resection,<sup>38</sup> but our experience has not supported this observation.</p>
                    <h3>Physis Affected</h3>
                        <p>Because proximal humeral and proximal femoral lesions are difficult to expose, a technically
                            adequate resection is less likely in these areas. In our institutional experience (currently
                            unpublished), distal femoral bars have a poorer prognosis for growth after resection, whereas
                            those of the distal tibia have a more favorable prognosis for the resumption of growth.</p>
                    <h3>Extent of the Arrest</h3>
                        <p>The potential for resumption of longitudinal growth after arrest resection is influenced by the
                            amount of physeal surface area affected.<sup>35,38,113</sup> Arrests affecting more than 25% of the total
                            surface area are unlikely to grow, and, except in patients in whom significant growth
                            potential remains, alternative treatment strategies should be used.</p>
                    <h3>Amount of Growth Remaining in the Physis Affected</h3>
                        <p>Some authors<sup>38,113,124,127,128,166</sup> have stated that 2 years of growth remaining based on skeletal
                            age determination is a prerequisite for arrest resection to be considered. Based on our results
                            with this procedure, we find that 2 years of growth remaining is an inadequate indication for
                            physeal arrest resection. We believe that the decision to perform arrest resection should be
                            made based on a combination of the calculated amount of growth remaining in the affected
                            physis and the likelihood of resumption of growth. A scanogram (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-30</span>) can be used to
                            determine the existing discrepancy, determination of skeletal age and consultation with the
                            growth remaining tables for the affected physis (<span class="figure_num">Table 2-1</span>)<sup>14,15,16,83,99,138</sup> will allow calculation
                            of the predicted discrepancy.</p>

                    <h3>Preoperative Planning and Surgical Principles</h3>
                        <p>If physeal arrest resection is considered appropriate, careful planning is required to maximize
                            the opportunity for resumption of longitudinal growth. First, the extent and location of the
                            arrest relative to the rest of the physis must be carefully documented. MRI is becoming the
                            imaging study of choice. We currently prefer 3D spoiled recalled gradient-echo images with
                            fat saturation or fast spin-echo proton density images with fat saturation to visualize the
                            physis. CT images allow precise delineation of bony margins and, at the current time, are
                            cheaper than MRI. An estimation of the affected surface area can be computed with the
                            assistance of the radiologist using a modification of the method of Carlson and Wenger (<span class="figure_num">Fig.
                            2-31</span>).<sup>47</sup> The procedure should be planned with consideration of the following principles:</p>
                        <img src="./images/Figure 2-31.jpg" alt="">
                        <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 2-31</span> Reconstructed MRIs allow estimation of the percentage of surface area of the
                            physis affected by a growth arrest.
                            This workstation reconstruction delineates the perimeter of normal physis (border 2) and that
                            of the physeal arrest (border 1). Surface area affected can be calculated from these
                            reconstructions.</p>
                        <h4>Minimize Trauma</h4>
                            <p>The arrest must be resected in a manner that minimizes trauma to the residual physis. Central
                                lesions should be approached either through a metaphyseal window (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-32</span>) or through
                                the intramedullary canal after a metaphyseal osteotomy. Peripheral lesions are approached
                                directly, resecting the overlying periosteum to help prevent reformation of the arrest.
                                Intraoperative imaging (fluoroscopy) is needed to keep the surgeon oriented properly to the
                                arrest and the residual healthy physis. Care to provide adequate visualization of the surgical
                                cavity is essential, because visualization is usually difficult even under “ideal”
                                circumstances. A brilliant light source, magnification, and a dry surgical field are very
                                helpful. An arthroscope can be inserted into a metaphyseal cavity to permit a circumferential
                                view of the resection area. A high-speed burr worked in a gentle to-and-fro movement
                                perpendicular to the physis is usually the most effective way to gradually remove the bony
                                bridge and expose the residual healthy physis (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-33</span>). By the end of the resection, all of
                                the bridging bone between the metaphysis and the epiphysis should be removed, leaving a
                                void in the physis where the arrest had been, and the perimeter of the healthy residual physis
                                should be visible circumferentially at the margins of the surgically created cavity (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-34</span>).
                                Recently, intraoperative CT has been reported to be an effective adjuvant to guide bar
                                resection.<sup>112</sup></p>

                        <h4>Prevent Reforming of Bridge Between Metaphysis and Epiphysis</h4>
                            <p>A bone-growth retardant or “spacer” material should be placed in the cavity created by the
                                arrest resection to prevent reforming of the bony bridge between the metaphysis and the
                                epiphysis. Four compounds have been used for this purpose either clinically or
                                experimentally: autogenous fat,<sup>38,113,124,127,128,129,130,210</sup> methyl-methacrylate,<sup>30,113,166</sup> silicone
                                rubber,<sup>35</sup> and autogenous cartilage.<sup>23,25,76,88,114,133</sup> Currently, only autogenous fat graft,
                                harvested either locally or from the buttock, and methyl methacrylate are used clinically.
                                Autogenous fat has at least a theoretic advantage of the ability to hypertrophy and migrate
                                with longitudinal and interstitial growth (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-35</span>).<sup>129,130</sup> Methyl methacrylate is inert, but
                                provides some immediate structural stability.<sup>41</sup> This feature may be important with large
                                arrest resections in weight-bearing areas, as in the proximal tibia in association with infantile
                                Blount disease. However, embedded methyl methacrylate, especially products without
                                barium to clearly delineate its location on radiograph, can be extremely difficult to remove
                                and can jeopardize bone fixation if subsequent surgery is required. Pathologic fracture
                                associated with methyl methacrylate migration from the metaphysis to diaphysis has also
                                been reported.<sup>191</sup></p>

                                obvious. The fat-filled cavity created at physeal arrest resection has persisted and elongated

                        <h4>Marker Implantation</h4>
                            <p>Metallic markers should be implanted in the epiphysis and metaphysis at the time of arrest
                                resection to allow reasonably accurate estimation of the amount of longitudinal growth that
                                occurs across the operated physis, as well as to identify the deceleration or cessation of that
                                growth (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 2-35</span>). We believe that precise monitoring of subsequent longitudinal growth
                                is an important aspect of the management of patients after arrest resection. First, resumption
                                of longitudinal growth may not occur despite technically adequate arrest resection in patients
                                with good clinical indications. Perhaps more importantly, resumption of normal or even
                                accelerated longitudinal growth may be followed by late deceleration or cessation of that
                                growth.<sup>91</sup> It is imperative that the treating surgeon be alert to those developments, so that
                                proper intervention can be instituted promptly. Embedded metallic markers serve those
                                purposes admirably.</p>
            <h1 id="2.5">Author's Observation</h1>
                <p>It has been our clinical observation that even patients who have significant resumption of
                    growth following arrest resection will experience premature cessation of longitudinal growth
                    of the affected physis relative to the contralateral uninvolved physis. We believe that even if
                    growth resumes after bar resection, the previously injured physis will cease growing before
                    the contralateral physis.</p>
                <p>Our experience with physeal arrest resection prompted several conclusions and treatment
                    recommendations.</p>
                <p>On average, approximately 60% of physeal arrests demonstrate clear radiograph evidence of
                    resumption of longitudinal growth of the affected physis after physeal arrest resection.
                    There is a correlation between the amount of surface area of the physis affected and the
                    prognosis for subsequent longitudinal growth after arrest resection. Physeal arrests affecting
                    less than 10% of the surface area of the physis have a better prognosis than larger arrests.
                    Langenskiold stage VI infantile Blount disease has results comparable to posttraumatic
                    physeal arrests.</p>
                <p>Etiologies other than posttraumatic and infantile Blount disease have poor prognoses for
                    subsequent growth.</p>
                <p>Central and peripheral arrests have equivalent prognoses with respect to resumption of
                    growth.</p>
                <p>Early growth resumption may be followed by cessation of longitudinal growth before
                    skeletal maturity. As a consequence, patients must be evaluated regularly until skeletal
                    maturity with some reliable method (such as metaphyseal and epiphyseal radiograph
                    markers) to detect such development as promptly as possible.</p>
                <p>We believe that physeal bar resection has a role to play in patients with significant
                    longitudinal growth remaining. However, the benefits of such surgery must be weighed
                    against the actual amount of growth remaining, and the etiology, location, and extent of the
                    physeal arrest must be considered. The appropriate time to add a corrective osteotomy to
                    bony bar resection is controversial. Generally, when the angular deformity is more than 10 to
                    15 degrees from normal, corrective osteotomy should be considered.</p>
