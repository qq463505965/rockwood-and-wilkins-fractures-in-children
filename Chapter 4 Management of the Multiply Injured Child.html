                    <p>The initial steps in resuscitation of a child are essentially the same as those used for an
                        adult.<sup class="reference" data-src="4_77.pdf">77</sup><sup>,88,99,141,151</sup> The primary survey begins with assessment of the <span class="emphasize_1">“ABCDEs”</span>—airway,
                        breathing, circulation, disability (neurologic), and exposure—followed by screening
                        radiographs (cervical spine, chest, and pelvis). In severe injuries, the establishment of an
                        <span class="emphasize_1">adequate airway</span> immediately at the accident site often means the difference between life and
                        death. <span class="emphasize_1">The cervical spine needs to be stabilized</span> for transport if the child is unconscious, or in
                        those with facial trauma and/or neck pain <span class="figure_num">(Fig. 4-1)</span>. A special transport board with an
                        occipital cutout is recommended for children younger than 6 years because head size is large,
                        relative to body size, in young patients. If a young child is placed on a traditional transport
                        board, the cervical spine is flexed, which may cause neurologic injury.<sup>67</sup></p>

                            multitrauma, especially those who are unconscious or complain of neck pain.</p>
                <h2 id="4.2.2">FLUID REPLACEMENT</h2>
                    <p>Once an adequate airway is established, the amount of hemorrhage from the injury, either
                        internally or externally, is assessed. Because of the prevalence of blunt trauma in pediatric
                        polytrauma patients, <span class="emphasize_1">most of the blood loss is internal</span> and is easily underestimated. The
                        blood loss is replaced initially with intravenous (IV) crystalloid solution. In younger
                        children, rapid IV access may be difficult. In this situation, <span class="emphasize_1">a large-bore intraosseous needle
                        can typically be inserted into the tibial metaphysis within 1 to 2 minutes</span> and then used to
                        deliver both fluids and drugs during resuscitation.<sup>10,108</sup></p>
                    <p>Because death is common if hypovolemic shock is not rapidly reversed, the child's blood
                        pressure must be maintained at an adequate level for organ perfusion. <span class="emphasize_1">A urinary catheter</span> is
                        used during the resuscitation to monitor urine output as a means of assessing organ
                        perfusion. In some instances, <span class="emphasize_1">a central venous catheter</span> is used to more precisely monitor
                        fluid resuscitation. In children with traumatic brain injuries, care is exercised during initial
                        fluid resuscitation since overhydration can exacerbate cerebral edema. Excessive fluid
                        resuscitation can also lead to fluid shifts and interstitial pulmonary edema, with potential
                        drops in arterial oxygenation, particularly following thoracic trauma.</p>

                        described in trauma patients as a result of hypovolemia and the systemic response to

                <h2 id="4.3.1">TRAUMA RATING SYSTEMS</h2>
                    <p>After initial resuscitation has stabilized the injured child's condition, it is essential to perform
                        a quick but thorough check for other injuries. At this point in the evaluation, a trauma rating
                        is often performed. The purpose of the trauma rating is twofold: To aid in triage and to
                        predict outcomes. Several trauma rating systems have been validated for the pediatric
                        population,<sup>16,27,28,35,44,46,61,79,91,105,109</sup> but the most commonly used are the GCS, the Injury
                        Severity Score (ISS), and the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS). Each of the scoring systems has
                        strengths and weaknesses. The ISS is a valid, reproducible rating system that can be widely
                        applied in the pediatric polytrauma setting (<span class="figure_num">Table 4-1</span>).<sup>166</sup> It is an ordinal, not a linear scale
                        (i.e., a score of 40 is not twice as bad as a score of 20). It has been found to be a valid
                        predictor of mortality, length of hospital stay, and cost of care.18 Another injury-rating
                        system for children that has been shown to be valid and reproducible is the PTS (<span class="figure_num">Table 4-
                        2</span>).<sup>166</sup> It has good predictive value for injury severity, mortality, and the need for transport to
                        a pediatric trauma center. However, it is a poor predictor of internal injury in children with
                        blunt abdominal trauma.<sup>128</sup> The BIG score has been advocated by some centers for its
                        prognostic value and ease of use.<sup>16,35,46</sup></p>

                        Injury Severity Score (ISS)<br>
                        The injury severity score (ISS) is a combination of values obtained from the AIS. 
                        The ISS is the sum of the squares of the highest AIS grade in each of the three most severely injured areas. 
                        For example, a person with a laceration of the aorta (AIS=5), 
                        multiple closed long-bone fractures (AIS=4), and retroperitoneal hemorrhage (AIS=3) 
                        would have an injury severity score of 50(25+16+9). 
                        The highest possible score for a person with trauma to a single area is 25. 
                        The use of the ISS has dramatically increased the correlation between the severity 
                        and mortality. The range of severity is from 0 to 75.</td></tr>

                <h2 id="4.3.2">PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT</h2>
                    <p>The <span class="emphasize_1">secondary survey</span> starts with a full history and physical examination. A careful
                        <span class="emphasize_1">abdominal examination</span> allows early detection of injuries to the liver, spleen, pancreas, or
                        kidneys. When present, ecchymosis on the abdominal wall must be noted, as it is often a sign
                        of significant visceral or spinal injury.<sup>23,40,78</sup></p>
                    <p>The <span class="emphasize_1">extremities</span> are checked for swelling, deformity, or crepitus. If extremity deformity is
                        present, it is important to determine whether the fracture is open or closed. Sites of external
                        bleeding are examined, and pressure dressings are applied if necessary to prevent further
                        blood loss. Imaging studies facilitate surgical planning.</p>
                    <p><span class="emphasize_1">Pelvic fractures</span> are high-energy injuries and often associated with significant morbidity and
                        mortality.<sup>33,37,112,133,140,144,161</sup> A pelvic fracture combined with one or more other skeletal
                        injuries has been suggested to be a marker for the presence of head and abdominal
                        injuries.<sup>160</sup> Major arterial injuries associated with fractures of the extremity are usually
                        diagnosed early by the lack of a peripheral pulse. In contrast, abdominal venous injuries
                        caused by blunt trauma—half of which are fatal—are rare and often remain undiagnosed
                        before exploratory laparotomy. Consequently, in children who continue to require substantial
                        blood volume support after the initial resuscitation has been completed, abdominal venous
                        injury should be considered.<sup>51</sup></p>
                    <p>Initial splinting of suspected extremity fractures is routinely done in the field. However, once
                        the injured child is in the hospital, the orthopedist should inspect the extremities to assess the
                        injuries and determine the urgency of definitive treatment.</p>
                    <p>Any <span class="emphasize_1">neurologic deficit</span> is noted and extremity function is documented prior to treatment. The
                        inability to obtain a reliable examination due to the child's age, mental status or pain from
                        distracting injuries should be documented.</p>
                    <p><span class="emphasize_1">Head injuries</span> and pain in other locations can result in injuries being missed initially. In a
                        series of 149 pediatric polytrauma patients, 13 injuries were diagnosed an average of 15 days
                        following the initial accident, including five fractures (one involving the spine), four
                        abdominal injuries, two aneurysms, one head injury, and one facial fracture.<sup>91</sup> Given this 9%
                        incidence of delayed diagnosis, polytrauma patients should be reexamined once they are
                        more comfortable to reassess for potential sites of injury. Despite careful inpatient
                        examinations, some pediatric injuries escape detection until follow-up visits. Children with
                        head injuries need to be reassessed once they awaken enough to cooperate with
                        reexamination. Families and patients should be informed of the frequency of delayed
                        diagnosis of some injuries in polytrauma patients so they can help identify additional
                        injuries, and are not surprised in the event of later diagnoses.</p>
                <h2 id="4.3.3">IMAGING STUDIES</h2>
                    <h3>Radiographs</h3>
                        <p><span class="emphasize_1">Primary screening radiographs classically consist of a cross-table lateral cervical spine,
                            anteroposterior chest, and anteroposterior pelvis.</span> In some centers, a lateral cervical spine
                            radiograph is obtained only if the child has a head injury or if neck pain is noted on physical
                            examination.</p>
                        <p><span class="emphasize_1">The lateral cervical spine radiograph detects 80% of C-spine injuries</span>.<sup>88</sup> If there is suspicion
                            of a cervical spine injury on the neutral lateral view, a lateral flexion radiograph of the
                            cervical spine taken in an awake patient will help detect any cervical instability safely.
                            The cervical spine of a young child is much more flexible than the cervical spine in an adult.
                            Under the age of 12 years, the movement of C1 on C2 during flexion of the neck can
                            normally be up to 5 mm, whereas in adults, this distance should be less than 3 mm. Likewise
                            in this young age group, the distance between C2 and C3 is up to 3 mm. No forward
                            movement of C2 on C3 should be present in a skeletally mature patient when the neck is
                            flexed. Pseudosubluxation of C2 on C3 in a child should not be diagnosed as instability that
                            requires treatment because this is a normal finding in young children.<sup>26,42</sup> Because it is
                            difficult to detect a fracture of the thoracic or lumbar spine clinically, radiographs of this
                            area, primarily a lateral view, should be carefully evaluated, particularly in a comatose child.
                            Imaging studies of any site of suspected musculoskeletal injury should be obtained as
                            quickly as possible after the initial resuscitation and physical examination.</p>
                    <h3>Computed Tomography</h3>
                        <p>CT is essential in evaluating a child with multiple injuries and often provides useful
                            information regarding injuries to the <span class="emphasize_1">head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis</span>.
                            CT of the pelvis is more sensitive for pelvic fractures than is a screening pelvic radiograph
                            (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 4-2</span>). Pelvic CT is useful for thoroughly evaluating fracture configuration and
                            determining appropriate treatment options, both surgical and nonsurgical. In one study, a
                            screening pelvic radiograph demonstrated only 54% of pelvic fractures identified on CT
                            scan.<sup>56</sup> A more recent study showed that CT scan resulted in a change in diagnosis of the
                            pelvic fracture (compared to plain radiograph findings) in 38% of cases, though treatment
                            was not changed, as none of their 30 patients required surgery.<sup>12</sup> If abdominal CT is being
                            done to evaluate visceral injury, the CT should be extended distally to include the pelvis.</p>
                        <img src="./images/Figure 4-2.jpg" style="position: relative;left:50%;transform: translate(-50%);">
                        <p style="text-align:center"><span class="figure_num">Figure 4-2</span> CT is more sensitive and specific for the identification and classification of
                            pediatric pelvic fractures.</p>
                        <p>CT of a fractured vertebra will provide the information needed to classify the fracture as
                            stable or unstable and determine whether operative treatment is needed. Some centers
                            evaluate the cervical spine with a CT scan in children with polytrauma who have neck pain, a
                            traumatic brain injury (TBI), or who have been drinking alcohol.<sup>130</sup> Further workup with
                            cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary before cervical spine
                            clearance in those who have persistent neck pain or tenderness despite normal plain films and
                            CT, and should be considered in patients who remain obtunded.</p>
                    <h3>Intravenous Pyelography</h3>
                        <p>There is a strong correlation of urologic injury with anterior pelvic fractures, as well as with
                            liver and spleen injury. Although CT and ultrasonography are used to evaluate renal injuries,
                            the IV pyelogram still has a role in helping to diagnose bladder and urethral injuries (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 4-
                            3</span>).<sup data-src="4_107.pdf" class="reference">107</sup></p>
                        <img src="./images/Figure 4-3.jpg" style="position: relative;left:50%;transform: translate(-50%);">
                        <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 4-3</span> Genitourinary injuries typically involve the urethra and/or bladder, are more
                            common in males than females, and are associated with anterior pelvic ring fractures.</p>
                    <h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h3>
                    <p>MRI is used primarily for the detection of injury to the <span class="emphasize_1">brain, spine, and spinal cord</span>. In
                        young children, the bony spine is more elastic than the spinal cord and spinal cord injury can
                        occur without an obvious spinal fracture, particularly in automobile accidents.<sup>6,17,42,45,49,170</sup> In
                        the spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) syndrome, MRI is
                        valuable in demonstrating the site and extent of spinal cord injury and in defining the level of
                        injury to the disks or vertebral apophysis. A fracture through the vertebral apophysis is
                        similar to a fracture through the physis of a long bone and may not be obvious on plain
                        radiographs.</p>
                    <h3>Ultrasonography</h3>
                        <p>Ultrasound evaluation can detect hemopericardium and intraperitoneal fluid following
                            injury.<sup>21,68,123</sup> The protocol most typically used is called “Focused Assessment with
                            Sonography for Trauma” (FAST). FAST consists of a rapid ultrasound examination of four
                            areas: the right upper abdominal quadrant, the left upper abdominal quadrant, the subxiphoid
                            area, and the pelvis. Though FAST has been used as a rapid screening tool in pediatric
                            polytrauma patients, it frequently misses intra-abdominal injuries following blunt
                            trauma.<sup>22,47,69,70,104</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_131.pdf">131</sup> Typically, its sensitivity for visceral injuries is lower than its
                            specificity. As a result, CT is more often used for assessment and monitoring of visceral
                            injury in children sustaining multiple injuries. Despite these limitations, hemodynamically
                            unstable children with a positive FAST are often taken for laparotomy rather than for CT
                            scanning.</p>

                        <p>Children recover more quickly and fully from significant head injuries than do adults, but
                            head injuries remain the most common cause of ongoing disability in children following
                            polytrauma.<sup>32,43,93,169</sup> Mild cognitive, problem-solving and/or learning deficits may persist, so
                            educational testing needs to be considered for children who have had significant head
                            injury.<sup>162</sup></p>
                        <p>The severity of <abbr title="traumatic brain injury" style="text-decoration:none">TBI</abbr> is the single most important determinant of long-term outcome in
                            polytraumatized children.<sup data-src="4_77.pdf" class="reference">77</sup> Better functional outcomes are reported at pediatric trauma
                            centers than at adult trauma centers following pediatric TBI, regardless of whether or not the
                            adult trauma center has added qualification in pedi atric trauma.<sup>118</sup> The resiliency of children
                            in the face of TBI was evident in one recent series, with approximately 15% of children who
                            presented with an initial GCS of 3 or 4 having a good outcome 10 years postinjury.<sup>52</sup>
                            Since children with brain injuries recover more fully than do adults, orthopedic care is based
                            on the assumption of full neurologic recovery. Without optimal orthopedic care, the primary
                            functional deficit may well result from ill-managed orthopedic injuries rather than from the
                            initial neurologic injury.</p>
                    <h3>INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE</h3>
                        <p>After a head injury, ICP is commonly monitored. Elevated ICP may exacerbate the sequelae
                            of TBI, leading to further permanent disability or death. ICP can be controlled by elevating
                            the head of the bed, lowering the PCO2 (via mechanical ventilation), and restricting IV fluids.
                            Since motion at the site of a long-bone fracture results in increased ICP, it is imperative that
                            long-bone fractures are immobilized until definitive fracture is provided.<sup>149</sup></p>
                    <h3>SECONDARY ORTHOPEDIC EFFECTS OF HEAD INJURIES</h3>
                        <p>A head injury can have direct impact on the musculoskeletal system. Head injury can lead to
                            spasticity, contractures, and heterotopic ossification (HO), and also accelerates fracture
                            healing.</p>
                        <h4>Spasticity</h4>
                            <p>Spasticity may develop within a few days of head injury. An early effect of this spasticity is
                                to cause shortening at the sites of long-bone fractures, despite traction or external
                                immobilization. Fracture displacement or shortening in a cast may cause skin breakdown and increase the risk of infection. Operative stabilization should be done as soon as possible
                                because fracture healing is accelerated by a head injury.<sup>149</sup></p>
                        <h4>Contractures</h4>
                            <p>Contractures commonly develop after polytrauma and TBI. The persistence of spasticity in
                                the extremities often leads to contractures of the joints spanned by the spastic muscles, but
                                attention to appropriate positioning and splinting in the trauma center can decrease
                                contracture frequency and severity. If the child lies in bed with the hips and knees extended,
                                this extensor positioning will usually result in plantarflexion of the ankles. Part-time
                                positioning with the hips and knees flexed helps prevent early equinus contractures from
                                developing. Stretching and splinting can often be effective in preventing contractures; casting
                                may be needed if contractures develop. If these measures are not successful and are
                                interfering with rehabilitation, the contractures may need to be released surgically.</p>
                        <h4>Heterotopic Bone Formation</h4>
                            <p>Heterotopic bone may form in the soft tissues within weeks after a significant head injury
                                with persistent coma.<sup>81,143</sup> Although any joint can be affected, the most common sites are the
                                hip and the elbow. There is some evidence that HO can be stimulated by surgical incisions
                                and can form at the insertion site in head-injured children who undergo antegrade femoral
                                intramedullary nailing.<sup>80</sup> HO should be considered in the differential diagnosis (along with a
                                new fracture and deep vein thrombosis) if new swelling is noted in the extremity of a
                                comatose child.<sup>139</sup> Technetium-99 bone scans show increased isotope uptake in the soft tissue
                                where heterotopic bone forms.</p>
                            <p>The two primary approaches to managing HO are observation and excision.<sup>81,143</sup> Observation
                                is the mainstay of treatment if the child remains comatose or if the child has recovered from
                                the head injury but the HO does not interfere with rehabilitation. Excision is chosen if there
                                is significant restriction of joint motion from the heterotopic bone which interferes with
                                rehabilitation. The timing of the heterotopic bone excision is controversial, but resection
                                should be considered whenever heterotopic bone significantly interferes with rehabilitation,
                                rather than waiting 12 to 18 months for the bone to mature. After surgical excision, early
                                postoperative prophylaxis with local low-dose radiation therapy or medications (salicylates
                                or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) decreases the risk of recurrence. Mital et
                                al.<sup>100</sup> reported success in preventing recurrence of heterotopic bone after excision by use of
                                salicylates at a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 6 weeks postoperatively.</p>
                        <h4>Fracture Healing Rates</h4>
                            <p>Long-bone fractures heal more quickly in children and adults who have associated head
                                injuries.<sup>174</sup> Delay in treatment of acute fractures can make reduction more difficult due to the
                                often early, exuberant callus formation.</p>
                <h2 id="4.4.2">PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES</h2>
                    <p>Although TBI most often accounts for persistent neurologic deficits in a child with multiple
                        injuries, one clinical review of brain-injured children reported that 7% had evidence of an
                        associated peripheral nerve injury documented by electrodiagnostic testing.<sup>116</sup> For closed
                        injuries, the peripheral nerve injury is typically associated with an adjacent fracture or with a
                        stretching injury of the extremity and observation is indicated in most cases because these
                        injuries often recover spontaneously. However, if the nerve injury is at the level of an open
                        fracture, then exploration of the nerve is indicated at the time of the initial surgery. If
                        function does not return within 2 to 3 months following observation of a closed injury, then
                        electrodiagnostic testing is indicated. If peripheral nerve injury is present, surgical repair
                        with nerve grafts offers an excellent chance of functional recovery in children and
                        adolescents.</p>
                <h2 id="4.4.3">THORACIC INJURIES AND PULMONARY CONTUSIONS</h2>
                    <p>Many are more limited with blunt
                        trauma and associated pulmonary contusion, while others involve damage to the great
                        vessels, with very high associated mortality.</p>
                    <p>Surfactant dysfunction follows and is most abnormal in patients with the most
                        severe respiratory failure. As the time from the injury increases, pulmonary function can
                        deteriorate and general anesthesia becomes more risky. Orthopedic surgical treatment before
                        such pulmonary deterioration limits the anesthetic risks in these patients. Bruises on the chest
                        or rib fractures should alert the orthopedist to potential pulmonary contusions as a part of the
                        injury complex. Initial chest radiographs may not clearly demonstrate the degree of
                        pulmonary parenchymal injury, and oxygen saturation (and arterial blood gas measurements)
                        is more useful in estimating the anesthetic risk of these patients during operative fracture
                        care.</p>
                <h2 id="4.4.4">ABDOMINAL INJURIES</h2>
                    <p>Abdominal swelling, tenderness, and bruising are all signs of injury.
                        Abdominal injury is common if a child in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) has been wearing
                        a lap seat belt, regardless of whether a contusion is evident.<sup>23,78,136,153</sup></p>
                    <p>Most hepatic and splenic lacerations are treated nonoperatively, by monitoring the
                        hematocrit, by performing serial abdominal examinations, and by serial
                        CT.<sup>24,29,30,36,76,103,119,147,156</sup></p>
                <h2 id="4.4.5">GENITOURINARY INJURIES</h2>
                    <p>Genitourinary system injuries are rare in the pediatric polytrauma population, though they
                        have been reported in 9% to 24% of children with pelvic fractures.<sup>33,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_107.pdf">107</sup><sup>,134,146,150</sup>
                        Injuries to the bladder and urethra are more common in males and are associated with
                        fractures of the anterior pelvic ring (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 4-4</span>).<sup>9</sup> Although less common following pelvic
                        fracture in girls, such injuries are often associated with injury to the vagina and rectum, with
                        long-term concerns regarding continence, stricture formation, and childbearing.<sup>41,117,125</sup> If the
                        iliac wings are displaced or the pelvic ring shape is changed, it may be necessary to reduce
                        these fractures to reconstitute the birth canal in female patients. There are increased rates of
                        cesarean section in young women who have had a pelvic fracture.<sup>33</sup> Adolescent females with
                        displaced pelvic fractures should be informed of this potential problem with vaginal delivery.
                        If the injury is severe, kidney injury may also occur, but most urologic injuries that occur
                        with pelvic fractures are distal to the ureters.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <p>Fat embolism and acute respiratory distress syndrome are rare in children.<sup>48,95,122,165</sup>
                        When fat embolism occurs, the signs and symptoms are
                        the same as in adults: <span class="emphasize_1">axillary petechiae, hypoxemia, and radiograph changes of pulmonary
                        infiltrates</span> appearing within several hours of the fractures. If a child with multiple fractures
                        without a head injury develops a change in sensorium and orientation, <span class="emphasize_1">hypoxemia</span> is the most
                        likely cause. The other primary cause of mental status change after fracture is
                        overmedication with narcotics.
                    </p>
                    <p>If fat embolism is diagnosed, the treatment is the same as in adults, generally with
                        <span class="emphasize_1">endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and hydration with IV fluid</span>.
                        Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism are much rarer in pediatric
                        trauma patients than in adults. The role of prophylaxis for pediatric deep venous

                    <p>Pediatric polytrauma patients have high caloric demands. If an injured child requires

                        supplementation may help avoid catabolism, improve healing, and minimize complications.
                        Children on mechanical ventilation in a PICU have been reported to require 150% of the

                            contamination, a type IIIC injury may, in fact, be associated with even a small wound in
                            some cases. Also, key distinguishing factors between types II and III fractures are the amount
                            of periosteal stripping of the bone, and the severity of the damage to the surrounding soft
                            tissues, not simply the size of the skin laceration (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 4-5</span>).</p>

                    <h3>Author's Preferred Method</h3>
                        <h4>Three Stages</h4>
                            <p>The treatment of open fractures in children is similar to that for open fractures in adults. The
                                primary goals are to prevent infection of the wound and fracture site, while allowing soft
                                tissue healing, fracture union, and return of optimal function. Initial emergency care includes
                                the ABCDEs of resuscitation, application of a sterile povidone-iodine dressing, and
                                preliminary alignment and splinting of the fracture. If significant bleeding is present, a
                                compression dressing is applied to limit blood loss. Tetanus toxoid is given for patients
                                whose immunization status is unknown, or if more than 5 years have passed since their last
                                dose. The initial dose of IV antibiotics is given. All open fractures are treated with operative
                                irrigation and debridement. The second stage of management is the primary surgical
                                treatment, including initial and (if necessary) repeat debridement of the tissues in the area of
                                the open fracture until the entire wound appears viable. The fracture is reduced and stabilized
                                at this time. If the bone ends are not covered with viable soft tissue, muscle or skin flap
                                coverage is considered. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy (Kinetic Concepts, Inc., San
                                Antonio, TX) may be a useful adjunct to facilitate coverage and obviate the need for flaps in
                                some patients.<sup>66,90,102,106,163,164</sup> VAC has been shown to shorten the time of healing of wounds
                                associated with open fractures.<sup>90</sup> The third and final stage of management is bony
                                reconstruction as needed if bone loss has occurred, followed by rehabilitation of the child.</p>
                        <h4>Cultures</h4>
                            <p>Previous studies have demonstrated poor correlation of growth on routine cultures with
                                wound infections.<sup>87,113,157</sup> Lee<sup>87</sup> reported that neither pre- nor postdebridement cultures
                                accurately predicted the risk of infection in open fractures, with only 20% (24/119) of
                                predebridement wounds with positive cultures and only 28% (9/32) with positive
                                postdebridement cultures becoming infected. Although postdebridement cultures were more
                                predictive of infection, these cultures identified the causative organism in only 42% (8/19) of
                                infected wounds. Valenziano et al.<sup>157</sup> found that cultures at the time of presentation to the
                                trauma center also were of no value, with only 2 of 28 patients (7%) with positive cultures
                                becoming infected, in comparison to 5 of 89 patients (6%) with negative initial cultures.
                                Initial cultures were positive in only two of seven cases that became infected. A recent
                                review of the literature found little data to support the routine use of pre- or postdebridement
                                cultures in open fractures.<sup>126</sup> Open fractures do not need to be routinely cultured. Cultures
                                should be obtained only at the time of reoperation in patients with clinical evidence of
                                infection.</p>
                        <h4>Antibiotic Therapy</h4>
                            <p>Antibiotic therapy decreases the risk of infection in children with open fractures. We limit antibiotic administration
                                generally to 48 to 72 hours after each surgical treatment of the open fracture.</p>
                            <p>For all type I and some type II fractures, we use a first generation cephalosporin (cefazolin
                                100 mg/kg/day divided q8h, maximal daily dose 6 g). For more severe type II fractures and
                                for type III fractures, we use a combination of a cephalosporin and aminoglycoside
                                (gentamicin 5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day divided q8h).<sup>86</sup></p>
                            <p>For farm injuries or grossly contaminated fractures, penicillin (150,000 units/kg/day divided
                                q6h, maximal daily dose 24 million units) is added to the cephalosporin and aminoglycoside.
                                All antibiotics are given intravenously for 24 to 72 hours.Oral antibiotics are occasionally used if significant soft tissue erythema at the open fracture
                                site remains after the IV antibiotics have been completed. Gentamicin levels should be
                                checked after four or five doses (and doses adjusted as necessary) to minimize the risk of
                                ototoxicity.</p>
                            <p>An additional 48-hour course is given around subsequent surgeries, such as those for repeat
                                irrigation and debridement, delayed wound closure, open reduction and internal fixation of
                                fractures, and secondary bone reconstruction procedures.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted, however, that the guidelines above were developed prior to the
                                widespread prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
                                aureus (MRSA). If the patient is at risk for MRSA, consideration should be given to adding
                                clindamycin or vancomycin to the regimen.</p>
                        <h4>Debridement and Irrigation</h4>
                            <p>After the initial dose(s) of antibiotics are given, debridement and irrigation of the open
                                fracture in the operating room is the next critical step in the primary management of open
                                fractures in children.The debridement needs to be performed carefully and
                                systematically to remove all foreign and nonviable materials from the wound. The order of
                                debridement typically is (1) excision of the necrotic tissue from the wound edges, (2)
                                extension of the wound to adequately explore the fracture ends, (3) debridement of the
                                wound edges to bleeding tissue, (4) resection of necrotic skin, fat, muscle, and contaminated
                                fascia, (5) fasciotomies as needed, and (6) thorough irrigation of the fracture ends and
                                wound.</p>
                            <p>Given the potential for devastating complications in children with open fractures treated
                                nonoperatively, we still advocate operative treatment of all such children.</p>
                            <p>For grade II and III fractures, since children generally heal better and have fewer
                                comorbidities than adults, it is often possible to do a <span class="emphasize_1">less aggressive debridement</span> at the initial
                                surgery, and wait until questionable tissue declares itself at a second look to determine the
                                <span class="emphasize_1"> necessary extent of debridement</span>.</p>
                            <p>When debriding and irrigating an open diaphyseal fracture, we typically bring the proximal
                                and distal bone ends into the wound to allow visual inspection and thorough irrigation and
                                debridement. This often necessitates extension of the open wound, which is preferable to
                                leaving the fracture site contaminated. We carefully remove devitalized bone fragments and
                                contaminated cortical bone with curettes or a small rongeur. If there is a possible nonviable
                                bone fragment, judgment is needed as to whether this bone fragment should be removed or
                                left in place. Small fracture fragments without soft tissue attachments are removed, whereas
                                very large ones may be retained if they are not significantly contaminated. Reconstruction of
                                a large segmental bone loss has a better outcome in children than in adults because children
                                have a better potential for bone regeneration and a better vascular supply to their extremities. 
                                Nearby major neurovascular structures in the area of the fracture are identified and protected. 
                                Debridement is complete when all contaminated, dead, and ischemic tissues have been excised; 
                                the bones' ends are clean with bleeding edges; and only viable tissue lines the
                                wound bed.</p>
                            <p>Several recent
                                studies, including the multicenter, randomized, blinded Fluid Lavage of Open Wound
                                (FLOW) study have found that <span class="emphasize_1">low-pressure lavage</span> is safer and more effective than highpressure
                                lavage.<sup>72,73,110,115</sup> Based on the most recent data, it appears that using a soap solution
                                to irrigate has a higher infection rate than irrigation with saline.<sup>72</sup> We routinely use 3 to 9 L
                                of normal saline for the lower extremities and 2 to 6 L in the upper extremities because of the
                                smaller compartment size.</p>
                            <p>After the debridement and irrigation are complete, local soft tissue is used to cover the
                                neurovascular structures, tendons, and bone ends. If local soft tissue coverage is inadequate,
                                consideration should be given to local muscle flaps or other coverage methods, including
                                VAC. The area of the wound that has been incised to extend the wound for fracture
                                inspection can be primarily closed. The traumatic wound should either be left open to drain
                                or may be closed over one or more drains. Wounds that are left open can be dressed with a
                                moistened povidone-iodine or saline dressing, but are probably better treated with a VAC.
                                Types II and III fractures are routinely reoperated on every 48 to 72 hours for repeat
                                irrigation and debridement until the wounds appear clean and the tissue viable. This cycle is
                                repeated until the wound can be sutured closed or a split-thickness skin graft or local flap is
                                used to cover it. If flap coverage is necessary, this is optimally accomplished within 1 week
                                of injury.</p>
                        <h4>Fracture Stabilization</h4>
                            <p>Fracture stabilization in children with open fractures decreases pain, protects the soft tissue
                                envelope from further injury, decreases the spread of bacteria, allows stability important for
                                early soft tissue coverage, decreases cerebral pressure, and improves the fracture union rate.
                                Principles for stabilization of open fractures in children include allowing access to the soft
                                tissue wound and the extremity for debridement and dressing changes, allowing weight
                                bearing when appropriate, and preserving full motion of the adjacent joints to allow full
                                functional recovery.</p>
                            <p>External fixators can be put on quickly and safely in the ICU or at bedside
                                without fluoroscopy for pelvic, femur, tibia, and other fractures for initial stabilization, with
                                the understanding that definitive alignment can be achieved later.</p>
                        <h4>Wound Management</h4>
                            <p>Serial irrigation and debridement are done every 2 to 3 days until the wounds are clean and
                                all remaining tissue appears viable. Fracture fixation at the time of initial surgery (as
                                described previously) facilitates wound management. We prefer to provide soft tissue
                                coverage of the open fracture and adjacent soft tissue defect by 5 to 10 days after the injury
                                to limit the risk of later infection. Most type I wounds heal with local dressing changes. For
                                some type II and type IIIA fractures, we use delayed wound closure or a split-thickness skin
                                graft over underlying muscle cover.</p>
                            <p><span class="emphasize_1">Large soft tissue loss</span> is most often a problem with types IIIB and IIIC fractures. <u>In the
                                proximal tibia</u>, plastic surgeons may be needed to provide a gastrocnemius rotational flap,
                                followed by secondary coverage of the muscle with a skin graft. <u>In the middle-third of the
                                leg</u>, a soleus flap is used with skin graft coverage, and a vascularized free muscle transfer is
                                necessary if local coverage is inadequate. Free flaps may be required for coverage of the
                                <u>distal third of the tibia</u>, especially in adolescents,<sup class="reference" data-src="4_84.pdf">84</sup><sup style="color:black;">,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_121.pdf">121</sup>although there is a high complication
                                rate. VAC sometimes can reduce the need for free tissue transfers. The VAC can convert
                                wounds that need free tissue to ones that need split-thickness skin graft or can heal completely.<sup class="reference" data-src="4_25.pdf">25</sup><sup style="color:black;">,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_66.pdf">66</sup><sup style="color:black;">,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_102.pdf">102</sup><sup style="color:black;">,</sup><sup class="reference" data-src="4_106.pdf">106</sup></p>
                            <p>The flaps and grafts used for reconstructing severe injuries are either muscle flaps or
                                composite grafts. For a massive loss of soft tissue and bone, composite grafts of muscle and
                                bone often are necessary. The younger the child, the better the likelihood that autogenous
                                graft will fill in a bone defect if there is a well-vascularized bed from the muscle flap. Free
                                flaps, especially from the latissimus dorsi, are useful in the mid-tibial and distal tibial regions
                                to decrease infection rates and improve union rates. Vascularized fibular grafts rarely are
                                used acutely to reconstruct bone defects, but may be useful after soft tissue healing.</p>
                            <p>For the rare case of significant bone defect in a child, we rely on the healing capacity of
                                young periosteum and bone and the vascular supply of a child's extremity (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 4-6</span>). An
                                external fixator is used to hold the bone shortened about 1 to 2 cm to decrease the size of the
                                bone loss. In a growing child, 1 to 2 cm of overgrowth can be expected in the subsequent 2
                                years after these severe injuries, so the final leg length will be satisfactory. Autogenous bone
                                graft can be used early, but if there is surviving periosteum at this site, spontaneous bone
                                formation often is surprisingly robust and may preclude the need for bone grafting. In
                                teenagers with bone loss, once the soft tissue has healed, bone transport using either a
                                uniplanar lengthening device or a circular thin wire external fixator is our preferred method
                                of reconstruction, although use of an allograft or vascularized fibular graft may be
                                considered.</p>

                                with external fixators. Despite the bone loss on the left, his periosteum was
                                preserved. B: One year later, there is healing and hypertrophy of the cortical bone, without

                        <h4>Amputation</h4>
                            <p>In children, attempts should generally be made to preserve all extremities, even with type
                                IIIC open fractures that are usually treated with primary amputation in adults. Wounds and
                                fractures that do not heal in adults often heal satisfactorily in children, and preservation of
                                limb length and physes are important in young children.Although the Mangled Extremity
                                Severity Score (MESS) correlates well with the need for amputation in adults, the correlation
                                is poor in children, and many limbs are salvageable despite a MESS of 7 or higher.<sup data-src="4_50.pdf" class="reference">50</sup></p>
                            <p>If amputation is absolutely necessary, as much length as possible should be preserved. For
                                example, if the proximal tibial physis is preserved in a male with a below-knee amputation at
                                age 7 years, 6 to 8 cm more growth of the tibial stump can be expected by skeletal maturity.
                                Thus, even a very short tibial stump in a skeletally immature child may grow to an
                                appropriate length by skeletal maturity. As a result, a short below-knee amputation at the
                                time of injury would likely be superior to a knee disarticulation in final function.
                                Although amputations to treat congenital limb deficits usually are done through the joint to
                                limit bone spike formation (overgrowth) at the end of the stump, we prefer to maintain
                                maximal possible length if amputation becomes necessary as a result of a severe injury.</p>

                            <p>In the setting of pediatric polytrauma, most long-bone fractures are treated
                                surgically, to facilitate patient care and rehabilitation.</p>

                                and timely treatment of their orthopedic injuries decreases their burden of musculoskeletal

                <h2 id="4.6.1">BENEFICIAL EFFECTS</h2>
                    <p>Fracture stabilization provides a number of nonorthopedic benefits to a child with multiple
                        injuries, including ease of patient mobilization and nursing care, decreased risks of pressure
                        sores, and better wound access.</p>
                    <h3>OPERATIVE FIXATION</h3>
                        <p>The most common methods used are
                            intramedullary rod fixation, external fixation, compression plating, and locking plating;
                            Kirschner wires or Steinmann pins may be used in conjunction with casts.</p>
                <h2 id="4.6.2">OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT OF THE MULTIPLY INJURED CHILD</h2>
                    <p>Though the vast majority of children survive following polytrauma, a large proportion
                        remain disabled at follow-up. In one review of 74 children with multiple injuries, 59 (80%)
                        survived, but after 1 year, 22% were disabled, mainly from a brain injury.<sup data-src="4_158.pdf" class="reference">158</sup></p>
                    <p>Although recognizing the need to care for the other organ system injuries, it is important to
                        advocate for expeditious treatment of the orthopedic injuries.</p>
