                    <p>Current evidence and consensus suggest that displaced supracondylar fractures are best
                        treated operatively with fixation.<sup>3,72,115,121</sup> Modern techniques for the treatment of
                        supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures in children have dramatically decreased the rates of
                        malunion and compartment syndrome.<sup>3,15,82,95,99,115,148</sup> Although there have been more than
                        500 peer-reviewed articles on supracondylar fractures over the last decade, there remains
                        poor consensus on many areas of treatment. An 88-question survey of 35 pediatric
                        orthopedic surgeons on the treatment of SCH fractures found consensus on only 27% of the
                        questions.<sup>73</sup></p>
                    <p>A database search showed that over 10,000 pediatric supracondylar fractures are seen in
                        emergency rooms each year in the United States.<sup>71</sup> Of the 24% of these treated surgically,
                        87% are closed reduced, and this proportion is growing over time (Fig. 13-1). Transfer rates
                        for these fractures increased from 5.6% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2011, generally transferring from
                        general or rural hospitals to academic or urban centers. One study comparing the treatment of
                        supracondylar fractures by pediatric orthopedic fellowship-trained surgeons to general
                        orthopedic surgeons found no statistical difference in the complication rate, though patients
                        treated by non-fellowship-trained surgeons were about four times more likely to have
                        inadequate fixation and 10 times more likely to have an open reduction.<sup>43</sup> There appears to
                        be a trend toward pediatric orthopedic specialists treating a higher proportion of these
                        injuries,<sup>79</sup> with one center reporting over a 100% increase in less than a decade.<sup>159</sup></p>

                    <p>SCH fractures are the most common elbow fractures seen in children,<sup>42</sup> and the most
                        common fracture requiring surgery in children. The peak age range at which most
                        supracondylar fractures occur is 5 to 6 years.<sup>28</sup></p>

                    <p>An elbow or forearm fracture should be suspected in a child with elbow pain or failure to use
                        the upper extremity after a fall. A careful examination of the entire arm should be performed,
                        and any area with tenderness or swelling should have radiographs as multiple fractures (such
                        as a supracondylar fracture and a radius/ulna fracture) are not uncommon (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-2</span>). In
                        children with acute elbow pain and failure to use the upper extremity, the differential
                        diagnosis should include fracture, nursemaid's elbow, inflammatory arthritis, and infection.</p>

                    <p>With a type I supracondylar fracture, there is tenderness about the distal humerus and
                        restriction of motion, particularly lack of full elbow extension. X-rays may be negative
                        except for a posterior fat pad sign. In type III fractures, gross displacement of the elbow is
                        evident (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-3</span>).</p>

                    <p>An anterior pucker sign may be present if the proximal fragment has penetrated the brachialis
                        and the anterior fascia of the elbow (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-4</span>). Skin puckering results from the proximal
                        segment piercing the brachialis muscle and engaging the deep dermis. This is a sign of
                        considerable soft tissue damage. If any bleeding from a punctate wound is present, this
                        should be considered an open fracture.</p>

                        This patient had penetration of the proximal fragment's spike into the subcutaneous
                        tissue. A: In the AP view, there is a large puckering or defect in the skin where the distal
                        fragment has pulled the skin inward (arrow). B: Laterally, there is puckering of the skin
                        (arrow) in the area where the spike has penetrated into the subcutaneous tissue.</p>
                    <p>Careful motor, sensory, and vascular examinations should be performed in all patients; this
                        may be difficult in a young child but should be attempted and recorded accurately. Sensation
                        should be tested in discrete sensory areas of the radial nerve (dorsal first web space), median
                        nerve (palmar index fingertip), and ulnar nerve (ulnar side little fingertip). If a child is not
                        cooperative or has altered mental status, a wet cloth may be wrapped around the hand and
                        checked for wrinkling of the skin, though in practice this is rarely done. In this test, a lack of
                        sensation is demonstrated in areas where the skin does not wrinkle. Motor examination
                        should include finger, wrist, and thumb extension (radial nerve), index finger distal
                        interphalangeal flexion and thumb interphalangeal flexion (anterior interosseous nerve, or
                        AIN), finger flexion strength (median), and interossei (ulnar nerve) muscle function. In
                        young children, the interosseous nerve may be tested by asking the child to pinch something
                        with their thumb and first finger, while palpating the first dorsal interosseous for muscle
                        contracture. If you cannot determine sensory and/or motor function accurately
                        preoperatively, it should be documented in the medical record and communicated to
                        appropriate caregivers. Misinformation preoperatively makes decision making
                        postoperatively difficult when a nerve or vascular deficit is discovered.</p>
                    <p>The vascular examination should include determining the presence of pulse, as well as
                        warmth, capillary refill, and color of the hand. Assessment of the vascular status is essential,
                        as series report up to 20% of displaced fractures present with vascular
                        compromise.31,124,140 The vascular status may be classified into one of three categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hand well perfused (warm and red), radial pulse present</li>
                        <li>Hand well perfused (warm and red), radial pulse absent</li>
                        <li>Hand poorly perfused (cool and blue or blanched), radial pulse absent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During the physical examination, a very high index of suspicion is needed in order not to
                        miss a developing compartment syndrome in fractures with considerable swelling and/or
                        ecchymosis, anterior skin puckering, and/or absent pulse. Possible firmness of the volar
                        compartment should be evaluated, and excessive swelling about the elbow should be noted.</p>
                    <p>Pain with passive finger extension and flexion should be noted. Recent studies show that
                        increasing anxiety and need for pain medicine may be the earliest warnings of compartment
                        syndrome. Pediatric patients with compartment syndromes often present with the three As:
                        anxiety, agitation, and increasing analgesic requirement.<sup>12</sup> In the initial examination of a
                        child with a severe supracondylar fracture with high parental and patient anxiety, it is easy to
                        overlook vital information. Be more suspicious of compartment syndrome with delayed
                        presentation or dysvascular hand.</p>
                    <h3>Mechanisms of Injury of Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal Humerus</h3>
                        <p>Supracondylar fractures can be divided into <span class="emphasize_1">extension and flexion types</span>, depending on the
                            direction of displacement of the distal fragment. Extension-type fractures, which account for
                            approximately 97% to 99% of SCH fractures<sup>100</sup> are usually caused by a fall onto the
                            outstretched hand with the elbow in full extension (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-5</span>). SCH fractures most frequently
                            result from falling, commonly off playground equipment.<sup>147</sup> It has been reported that the
                            overall safety of playground design can influence the likelihood of an SCH fracture, with
                            children using the least safe playgrounds having almost five times the rate of SCH fracture as
                            those using the safest playgrounds.<sup>120</sup></p>

                        <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 13-5</span> Mechanism of injury—elbow hyperextension.
                            A: Most children attempt to break their falls with the arm extended, and the elbow then
                            hyperextends. B: The linear applied force (large arrow) leads to an anterior tension force.
                            Posteriorly, the olecranon is forced into the depths of the olecranon fossa (small
                            arrow). C: As the bending force continues, the distal humerus fails anteriorly in the thin
                            supracondylar area. D:When the fracture is complete, the proximal fragment can continue
                            moving anteriorly and distally, potentially harming adjacent soft tissue structures such as the
                            brachialis muscle, brachial artery, and median nerve.</p>
                        <p>Most of this chapter is on extension-type fractures, with flexion-type fractures being covered
                            at the end of the chapter. The medial and lateral columns of the distal humerus are connected
                            by a thin segment of bone between the olecranon fossa posteriorly and coronoid fossa
                            anteriorly, resulting in a high risk of fracture to this area (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-6</span>). In a normal anatomic
                            variant, the olecranon fossa may be absent (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-7</span>). Another normal anatomic variant is
                            the supracondylar process, which is present to some extent in about 1.5% of adult cadavers
                            and should not be mistaken for fracture pathology. However, this anatomic variant can be the
                            site of median nerve compression (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-8</span>).</p>

                        <p>With forced elbow hyperextension, the olecranon forcefully pushes into the olecranon fossa
                            and acts as a fulcrum, while the anterior capsule simultaneously provides a tensile force on
                            the distal humerus at its insertion. The resulting injury is an extension-type SCH fracture. It
                            has been postulated that ligamentous laxity with resulting elbow hyperextension may
                            predispose to an SCH fracture,<sup>112</sup> but this association is unclear. Generally, medial
                            displacement of the distal fragment is more common than lateral displacement, occurring in
                            approximately 75% of patients in most series. Whether the displacement is medial or lateral
                            is also important because it determines which soft tissue structures are at risk from the
                            penetrating injury of the proximal metaphyseal fragment. Medial displacement of the distal
                            fragment places the radial nerve at risk, and lateral displacement of the distal fragment places
                            the median nerve and brachial artery at risk (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-9</span>).<sup>98</sup></p>

                            The proximal metaphyseal spike penetrates laterally with posteromedially displaced fractures
                            and places the radial nerve at risk; with posterolaterally displaced fractures, the spike
                            penetrates medially and places the median nerve and brachial artery at risk.

                            (AP) and lateral views of the entire upper extremity. Comparison views are rarely required
                            by an experienced orthopedist, but occasionally may be useful to evaluate an ossifying
                            epiphysis. Beware that the emergency room physician's interpretation of elbow fractures in
                            children has been reported to have an overall accuracy of only 53%.<sup>142</sup></p>
                        <p>Radiographic examination begins with a <span class="emphasize_1">true AP view</span> of the distal humerus. (In contrast, an
                            AP of an elbow in 90 degrees of flexion will give a roughly 45-degree angulated view of the
                            distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna.) A true AP view of the distal humerus allows a
                            more accurate evaluation of the distal humerus and decreases the error in determining
                            Baumann's angle. The lateral film should be taken as <span class="emphasize_1">a true lateral</span> with the humerus held in
                            the anatomic position and not externally rotated (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-10</span>). Oblique views of the distal
                            humerus occasionally may be helpful when a supracondylar fracture or occult condylar
                            fracture is suspected but not seen on standard AP and lateral views, but should not be
                            routinely ordered to evaluate for a supracondylar fracture.</p>

                        <p>Two main radiographic parameters are used to evaluate the presence of a supracondylar
                            fracture. The <b>anterior humeral line</b> (<b>AHL</b>) should cross the capitellum on a true lateral of the
                            elbow. Previous editions of this text and others have stated that in a normal elbow, the AHL
                            should pass through the middle third of the capitellum. However, it has been demonstrated
                            by Herman that in a normal elbow, the AHL passes through the middle third of the
                            capitellum only 52% of the time in children under 10 years of age, and in children younger
                            than 4 years of age, the AHL is equally likely to pass through the anterior third of the
                            capitellum as the middle third (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-12</span>).<sup>68</sup> Ryan et al.<sup>134</sup> found that the AHL should pass
                            through the center of the capitellum in all children 5 years and older, and if it does not,
                            pathology should be suspected. In an extension-type supracondylar fracture, the capitellum is
                            posterior to this line. Note that the “hourglass” should be tilted slightly forward in a true
                            lateral view of a normal elbow (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-11A</span>) and can help aid in the diagnosis of a type
                            II SCH fracture.</p>

                        <p><b>Baumann's angle</b>, also referred to as the humeral capitellar angle, is the angle between the

                            epiphyseal separation, the fracture propagates through the physis without a metaphyseal
                            fragment. This fracture occurs in very young children with primarily chondral epiphyses. On
                            physical examination, the patient appears to have a supracondylar fracture with gross
                            swelling about the elbow and marked discomfort. The key to making the diagnosis and
                            differentiating this injury from an elbow dislocation radiographically is seeing that the
                            capitellum remains aligned with the radial head. A thin metaphyseal fragment, which may
                            make one think of a lateral condyle fracture, usually can be seen, which technically makes
                            this a Salter type II fracture (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-15</span>). In such cases, more data is required to make the
                            diagnosis and initiate treatment. An arthrogram may be helpful (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-16</span>). In selected

                            <p>A modified Gartland classification of SCH fractures is the most commonly accepted and
                                used system.<sup>3,56,115</sup> The modified Gartland classification had less intra- and interobserver
                                variability than did any fracture classification systems previously studied according to a
                                study by Barton et al.<sup>14</sup> A recent study of functional outcomes following operative treatment
                                of 652 patients using PODCI and QuickDASH did not find a relationship of outcomes and
                                Gartland type, or direction of displacement.<sup>45</sup> As outcomes were generally excellent, this
                                may be due to a basement effect of the outcome instruments.</p>

                                <p>A Gartland type I fracture is a nondisplaced or minimally displaced (&lt;2 mm) supracondylar
                                    fracture with an intact AHL. There may or may not be any evidence of osseous injury: The
                                    posterior fat pad sign may be the only evidence of fracture. There should be an intact
                                    olecranon fossa, no medial or lateral displacement, no medial column collapse, and a normal
                                    Baumann's angle. These fractures are stable.</p>
                            <h5>Type II</h5>
                                <p>A Gartland type II fracture is a pure sagittal plane deformity. It is displaced (&gt;2 mm) with a
                                    presumably intact, yet hinged, posterior cortex. The AHL is usually anterior to the capitellum
                                    on a true lateral of the elbow (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-17</span>), though in mildly displaced fractures, the AHL
                                    may touch the capitellum (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-18</span>). If there is significant rotation in the coronal or
                                    transverse plane, it is a type III fracture. There is little benefit in dividing type II fractures
                                    into subtypes, although clearly this is a clinical continuum with some injuries more severe
                                    and unstable than others.</p>

                                <p>Leitch et al. retrospectively reviewed 297 displaced extension-type supracondylar fractures
                                    and described 9 of 297 (3%) with multidirectional instability. These fractures are
                                    characterized by an incompetent periosteal hinge circumferentially and defined by being
                                    unstable in both flexion and extension.<sup>97</sup> This multidirectional instability is usually
                                    determined under anesthesia at the time of operation when on a lateral view the capitellum is
                                    anterior to the AHL with elbow flexion, and posterior to the AHL with elbow extension
                                    (<span class="figure_num">Figs. 13-21</span> and <span class="figure_num">13-22</span>). This pattern of instability may result from the initial injury or may
                                    occur iatrogenically during a forceful attempted reduction. Classifying this as a separate type
                                    of fracture is warranted as it has treatment implications, as discussed later in this chapter, and
                                    has gained wide acceptance.<sup>3</sup> As a type I fracture is treated nonoperatively, and type II
                                    fractures are treated operatively, the lateral radiograph, which distinguishes these two
                                    fractures, deserves special consideration. Assume the AP radiographs have a normal

                                <p>An alternative classification system was described in 2006 that could cause confusion as it
                                    unfortunately uses similar terms (types I to IV) as the established Gartland classification, but
                                    with different definitions.<sup>154</sup> According to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen
                                    (AO) Pediatric Comprehensive Classification, these fractures are classified with regard to the
                                    degree of displacement at four levels (I to IV): no displacement (type I), displacement in one
                                    plane (type II), rotation of the distal fragment with displacement in two planes (type III), and
                                    rotation with displacement in three planes (or no contact between bone fragments) (type

                                    with comminution and collapse of the medial column (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-23</span>). Medial collapse signifies
                                    malrotation in the frontal plane (which defines the injury as at least a type II fracture) and is
                                    associated with a loss of Baumann's angle and varus malalignment. The lateral view (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-
                                    24</span>) may show reasonable alignment, which may lull the inexperienced into not appreciating
                                    the seriousness of this fracture, which requires reduction and usually pin fixation to prevent
                                    late malunion.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Management of Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal
                        Humerus</h3>
                        <p>Displaced supracondylar fractures requiring a reduction should be initially splinted with the
                            elbow in a comfortable position of approximately 20 to 40 degrees of flexion, while avoiding
                            tight bandaging. If the arm is pulseless, gentle traction and elbow flexion alone frequently
                            restore a pulse. Excessive flexion or extension may compromise the limb's vascularity and
                            increase compartment pressure.<sup>16,103</sup> The elbow and hand should then be gently elevated
                            above the heart.</p>
                        <h4>Urgency of Treatment</h3>
                            <p>Several studies have concluded that delay of surgery of even over 24 hours did not have any
                                deleterious effects on the outcomes of children with supracondylar fractures.<sup>55,63,143</sup> These
                                studies were all retrospective and may have reported good results in large part because of the
                                selection bias of experienced pediatric orthopedic surgeons selecting which fractures
                                required urgent treatment, such as those with neurovascular injuries.<sup>55</sup> A recent survey of 309
                                members of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America found that 81% of the
                                respondents would treat a type III supracondylar humerous fracture (SCHF) presenting after
                                normal work hours by splinting overnight and fixing the following morning, if there were no
                                issues necessitating emergent fixation.<sup>27</sup> Type II fractures may be a special case in this
                                regard. Larson et al. reported on 399 consecutive cases in which it appears that timing for the
                                operative treatment of type II fractures did not affect outcome, with 52% of the fractures
                                having surgery more than 24 hours after injury.<sup>93</sup> There were no compartment syndromes or
                                vascular injury in this group. Although there is little published data to support our opinion,
                                we and others believe that if conditions such as poor perfusion, pulselessness, an associated
                                displaced forearm fracture, firm compartments, skin puckering, antecubital ecchymosis, or
                                very considerable swelling are present, operative treatment should not be unduly
                                delayed.<sup>3,110,121,129</sup></p>
                        <h4>How Late Can Fractures Be Reduced?</h4>
                            <p>Little has been written about how long after injury a fracture can still be closed reduced.
                                Silva et al.<sup>146</sup> reported on 42 type II SCH fractures treated 7 to 15 days after injury. They
                                found that closed anatomic reduction was achieved in all fractures, with equal outcomes to
                                fractures treated within 7 days of injury. We would caution that in very young children,
                                reliable fracture reduction 2 weeks after injury with early callus formation is less likely. Two
                                children closed reduced 8 days after injury developed avascular necrosis of the
                                trochlea.<sup>146</sup> Although these numbers are small, this phenomenon seems worthy of further
                                study. Lal and Bhan<sup>90</sup> reported that delayed open reduction (11 to 17 days after injury) did
                                not increase the frequency of myositis ossificans. If a supracondylar fracture is unreduced or
                                poorly reduced, delayed open reduction and pin fixation appear to be justified.</p>
                    <h3>Nonoperative Management of Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal Humerus</h3>
                        <h4>Closed Reduction and Casting</h4>
                            <p>Closed reduction and casting of SCH fractures is not practiced in most modern centers. Most
                                pediatric orthopedic surgeons reserve cast immobilization for stable, nondisplaced fractures
                                (type I) that do not require reduction. Mildly displaced fractures can be reduced closed, using
                                the intact posterior periosteum as a stabilizing force and then holding reduction by flexing
                                the elbow greater than 120 degrees. Less flexion increases the risk of loss of reduction. The
                                concern with closed reduction and flexion greater than 120 degrees is the risk of vascular
                                compromise and/or compartment syndrome in the presence of anterior swelling and
                                compression. If closed reduction and casting is performed, the patients need to be monitored
                                closely for neurovascular compromise and loss of reduction. Follow-up radiographs require
                                AP views of the distal humerus to interpret with elbow flexion beyond 120 degrees. If
                                necessary, rereduction or conversion to pinning needs to occur before full healing occurs, so,
                                close radiographic follow-up is necessary in the first 3 weeks.</p>
                        <h4>Traction</h4>
                            <p>Traction as definitive treatment for supracondylar fractures in children is largely of historic
                                interest now. Indications for traction may include lack of anesthesia, medical conditions
                                prohibiting anesthesia, lack of an experienced surgeon, or severe open wounds.
                                Devnani<sup>40</sup> reported using traction in the gradual reduction of eight fractures with late
                                presentation (mean of 5.6 days), though 18% of these children went on to a corrective
                                osteotomy for malunion. Rates of cubitus varus from 9% to 33% have been reported in some
                                series,<sup>70,127</sup> whereas others have reported excellent results.<sup>54,170</sup> Traction is difficult to justify
                                economically due to prolonged hospitalization necessary, given the excellent results with
                                closed reduction and pinning, which usually requires no more than one-night hospitalization
                                and is associated with a low rate of intraoperative complications.</p>
                    <h3>Operative Management of Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal Humerus</h3>
                        <h4>Closed Reduction and Pinning</h4>
                            <p>Closed reduction and pinning is the most common operative treatment of supracondylar
                                fractures. An initial attempt at closed reduction is indicated in almost all displaced
                                supracondylar fractures that are not open fractures. Under general anesthesia, the fracture is
                                first reduced in the frontal plane with fluoroscopic verification. The elbow is then flexed
                                while pushing the olecranon anteriorly to correct the sagittal deformity and reduce the
                                fracture. Criteria for an acceptable reduction include restoration of Baumann's angle
                                (generally >10 degrees) on the AP view, intact medial and lateral columns on oblique views,
                                and the AHL passing through the middle third of the capitellum on the lateral view. As there
                                is considerable rotation present at the shoulder, minor rotational malalignment in the axial
                                plane can be tolerated at the fracture site. However, any rotational malalignment is
                                detrimental to fracture stability, so if present, be extra careful in assessing stability of
                                reduction.</p>
                            <p>The fracture reduction is generally held with two to three Kirschner wires (K-wires) by
                                lateral entry with divergence of pins. The elbow is immobilized in 40 to 60 degrees of
                                flexion depending on the amount of swelling and vascular status. If there is a considerable
                                gap in the fracture site or the fracture is irreducible with a “rubbery” feeling on attempted
                                reduction, the median nerve and/or brachial artery may be trapped in the fracture site and an
                                open reduction should be performed (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-25</span>).</p>

                                If a reduction feels rubbery, and a gap at the fracture site is seen on imaging, entrapment is

                                <p>Recent papers suggest that lateral entry pins are being used more commonly than cross-pins
                                    for most supracondylar fractures.<sup>1,5,17,27,86,101</sup> A recent survey of 309 members of the Pediatric
                                    Orthopaedic Society of North America found that 70% of respondents prefer lateral
                                    pins.<sup>27</sup> Some series report that when a medial pin is used, there are more complications<sup>168</sup> or
                                    longer surgical time,<sup>86</sup> and other series find no difference.<sup>55,169</sup></p>
                                <p>The two main issues with crossed pin versus lateral entry pinning of SCH fractures are risk
                                    of ulnar nerve injury and risk of loss of reduction. Iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve with
                                    use of crossed pins has been reported to be as low as 0% but three large series of
                                    supracondylar fractures at major pediatric centers have shown the prevalence to be 5% (17 of
                                    345), 5% (14/297), and 6% (19 of 331).<sup>1,24,38,99,130,150,171</sup> Others have reported that these
                                    injuries occur more commonly.<sup>166</sup> A meta-analysis of 1,158 patients in seven randomized
                                    controlled trials (RCTs) and six prospective comparative cohorts found iatrogenic ulnar
                                    nerve injury was over 10 times more likely when a medial pin was used, compared to lateral
                                    entry pins (4.1% [20/493] vs. 0.3% [2/666]) but no difference in loss of fixation between the
                                    two techniques.<sup>38</sup> Smaller series reported a 13% (5/39) risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury
                                    when pediatric orthopedic fellowship-trained surgeons used a medial pin,<sup>43</sup> and one series
                                    even reported 21% (10/48) rate of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury with a medial pin.<sup>17</sup></p>
                                <p>Three recent meta-analyses have examined the issue of pin configuration and iatrogenic
                                    nerve injury. In 2010, Slobogean et al.<sup>153</sup> reported on 32 trials with 2,639 patients and found
                                    there was an iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury for every 28 patients treated with crossed pins
                                    compared to lateral-pinning. In the same year, Babal et al.<sup>10</sup> reported on a systematic review
                                    of 35 articles discussing medial and lateral-pinning versus lateral entry pinning and found
                                    that iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury occurred in 40 of 1,171 (3.4%) of cross-pins and 5 of 738
                                    (0.7%) of lateral entry pins. The 2012 report by Woratanarat et al.<sup>168</sup> included 18 studies and
                                    1,615 SCH fractures. They reported the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury to be 4.3 times
                                    higher in cross-pinning compared to lateral-pinning. They found no difference in loss of
                                    fixation, late deformity, or Flynn criteria between the two types of pinning.</p>
                                <p>A prospective, surgeon-randomized study was performed on 104 children with type III SCH
                                    fractures, with surgeons using their preferred techniques of cross-pins or lateral entry pins.
                                    The authors found no statistical difference in the radiographic outcomes between lateral entry
                                    and cross-pin techniques, but two cases of iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve occurred with
                                    medially placed pins.<sup>57</sup></p>
                                <p>Zaltz et al.<sup>171</sup> reported that in children less than 5 years of age, when the elbow is flexed more
                                    than 90 degrees, the ulnar nerve migrated over, or even anterior to, the medial epicondyle in
                                    61% (32/52) of children. Wind et al.<sup>166</sup> showed that the location of the ulnar nerve cannot be
                                    adequately determined by palpation to allow blind medial pinning. Unfortunately, even
                                    making an incision over the medial epicondyle to make certain the ulnar nerve is not directly
                                    injured by a pin does not ensure protection of the nerve.<sup>150</sup></p>
                                <p>In a series of six cases of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injuries with early exploration, the nerve was
                                    directly penetrated by the pin in two of six cases (33.3%), with constriction of the cubital
                                    tunnel occurring in three of six cases (50%), and the nerve being fixed anterior to the medial
                                    epicondyle in one of six (16.7%) cases.<sup>130</sup> Thus, even if direct penetration of the ulnar nerve
                                    is avoided, simply placing a medial epicondyle entry pin adjacent to the nerve can cause
                                    injury, presumably by constriction of the cubital tunnel or kinking of the nerve. Iatrogenic
                                    ulnar nerve injuries usually resolve, but there have been several reports of permanent
                                    iatrogenic ulnar nerve injuries.<sup>128,130,150</sup></p>
                                <p>A series of 345 SCH fractures<sup>150</sup> treated by percutaneous pinning showed that the use of a
                                    medial pin was associated with a 4% (6/149) risk of ulnar nerve injury when the medial pin
                                    was placed without hyperflexion and 15% (11/71) if the medial pin was placed with
                                    hyperflexion. None of the 125 fractures treated with lateral entry pins alone resulted in
                                    iatrogenic injury. This is consistent with the findings of Zaltz et al.<sup>171</sup> of anterior subluxation
                                    of the ulnar nerve with elbow flexion beyond 90 degrees. Thus, one apparently undeniable
                                    conclusion is that if a medial pin is used, the lateral pins should be placed first, then the
                                    elbow extended and the medial pin placed without hyperflexion of the elbow.</p>
                                <p>The second issue with pin configuration is stability of pin configuration. Biomechanical
                                    studies of stability of various pin configurations have been somewhat misleading. Two
                                    studies evaluated the torsional strength of pin configurations and found crossed pins to be
                                    stronger than two lateral pins.<sup>116,172</sup> Unfortunately, in these studies, the two lateral pins were
                                    placed immediately adjacent to each other and not separated at the fracture site as is
                                    recommended clinically for lateral entry pins.<sup>67,122,137,148</sup> In synthetic humeri study,
                                    Srikumaran et al.<sup>155</sup> found cross-pins to be stronger than two lateral entry pins, but did not
                                    test three lateral entry pins. Lee et al.<sup>96</sup> found that two divergent lateral pins separated at the
                                    fracture site were superior to crossed pins in extension loading and varus but were equivalent
                                    in valgus (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-26</span>). The greater strength seen with divergence of the pins was attributed to
                                    the location of the intersection of the two pins and greater divergence between the two pins,
                                    which would allow for some purchase in the medial column as well as the lateral column.</p>

                                <p>Bloom et al.<sup>19</sup> reported that three lateral entry divergent pins were equivalent to crosspinning
                                    and both were stronger than two lateral divergent pins. Another study with simulated
                                    medial comminution showed that three lateral divergent pins had equivalent torsional
                                    stability to standard medial and lateral crossed pinning.<sup>94</sup> Feng et al.<sup>48</sup>reported that two and
                                    three lateral entry pins had comparable construct stiffness to each other, and both were
                                    greater than crossed pins to all types of stress, except in valgus, in which cross-pins had
                                    greater stiffness. Thus, contemporary biomechanical studies mostly support clinical
                                    recommendations of lateral entry pins.<sup>3,115,137,148</sup></p>
                                <p>Multiple biomechanical studies have reported that larger pins provide more stability.<sup>61,126,155</sup>

                                <p>In a study of eight other cases of SCH fractures, which lost reduction, Sankar et al. reported
                                    that loss of fixation in all cases was because of technical errors that were identifiable on the
                                    intraoperative fluoroscopic images and that could have been prevented with proper
                                    technique. They identified three types of pin-fixation errors<sup>137</sup>: failure to engage both
                                    fragments with two or more pins, failure to achieve bicortical fixation with two pins or more,
                                    and failure to achieve adequate pin separation (&gt;2 mm) at the fracture site. A systematic
                                    review of 35 articles reported loss of reduction in 0 of 849 of crossed pins and 4 of 606
                                    (0.7%) of lateral entry pins.<sup>22</sup> Based on this study and the previous series by Skaggs et
                                    al.,<sup>148</sup> we recommend a minimum of two pins for a type II fracture and three pins for a type
                                    III fracture.</p>
                                <p>A recent study of 192 patients concluded that pin spread is an important factor associated
                                    with preventing loss of reduction, with the goal of pin spacing at least 13 mm or one-third the
                                    width of the humerus at the level of the fracture.<sup>122</sup></p>
                                <p>Two prospective randomized clinical trials comparing lateral- and cross-pinning techniques
                                    in the treatment of displaced SCH fractures showed no statistically significant difference
                                    between the two treatment groups in any radiographic or clinical outcome
                                    measures,<sup>82,158</sup> including nerve injury. It is interesting that following the randomized clinical
                                    trial,<sup>82</sup> the same eight surgeons who used cross-pins in 59% of SCH fractures pretrial
                                    changed their practice to use cross-pins in only 15% of cases posttrial.<sup>101</sup></p>
                                <p>An alternative technique using antegrade insertion of elastic intramedullary nailing has been
                                    described.<sup>41</sup> This technique seems needlessly invasive to the uninvolved upper humerus
                                    when pinning of the fracture site reliably results in excellent results in most cases.</p>
                        <h4>Open Reduction</h4>
                            <p>Open reduction is indicated in cases of <span class="emphasize_1">failed closed reduction</span>, <span class="emphasize_1">a loss of pulse</span>, <span class="emphasize_1">poor
                                perfusion</span>, or <span class="emphasize_1">nerve injury following reduction</span>, and <span class="emphasize_1">open fractures</span>. Over time, the rate of
                                open reductions in the United States has been steadily decreasing over time, with about 6%
                                in the most recent year reported (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-27</span>).<sup>71</sup> Specialized pediatric trauma centers report
                                even lower numbers, such as 0.7% (9/1,296) at Denver Children's Hospital,<sup>55</sup> and 2% (8/339)
                                at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.<sup>150</sup> In the past, open reductions led to concerns of elbow
                                stiffness, myositis ossificans, scarring, and iatrogenic neurovascular injury. However, several
                                reports have shown the low rate of complications associated with open reduction, and this is
                                in the setting of more severe soft tissue and bony injuries. Ay et al.<sup>9</sup> found no loss of motion
                                or clinical deformity in 61 patients treated with open reduction. In a prospective, randomized
                                controlled study of 28 children, Kaewpornsawan<sup>75</sup> compared closed reduction and
                                percutaneous pin fixation with open reduction (through a lateral approach); the patients
                                treated with percutaneous pin fixation showed no differences with regard to cubitus varus,
                                neurovascular injury, the range of motion (ROM), the infection rate, the union rate, or the
                                criteria of Flynn et al.<sup>53</sup> In older children with SCH fractures (8 to 14 years of age), Mollon et
                                al.<sup>107</sup> reported a mean loss of 30 degrees of elbow flexion at final follow-up in those patients
                                treated with open reduction internal fixation compared with those treated with closed
                                reduction percutaneous pinning. Twenty-two-year follow-up of 49 patients in Turkey showed
                                84% good functional outcome, with a mean of 4 degrees varus/valgus difference from the
                                contralateral side, and a mean of 5 degrees flexion deficit and 4 degrees extension deficit.<sup>65</sup></p>

                            <h5>Surgical Approach</h5>
                                <p>The <span class="emphasize_1">direct anterior approach</span> to the elbow is extremely useful for open reduction, particularly
                                    in cases of neurovascular compromise. The anterior approach has the advantages of allowing
                                    direct visualization of the brachial artery and median nerve as well as the fracture fragments.
                                    The exposure is through the torn periosteum and disrupted brachialis and therefore does not
                                    further destabilize the fracture. When performed through a relatively small (5 to 8 cm)
                                    transverse incision above the cubital fossa at the fracture site, the resulting scar is much more
                                    aesthetic than that of the lateral approach, and scar contraction limiting elbow extension is
                                    not an issue. A series of 26 patients treated with the anterior approach showed equivalent
                                    results to the traditional lateral or combined lateral with medial approach in terms of
                                    malunion, Flynn criteria,<sup>53</sup> and ROM.</p>
                                <p>The posterior approach for an extended supracondylar fracture risks a higher rate of loss of
                                    motion, further fracture instability with exposure through intact periosteum, and, most
                                    importantly, the risk of avascular necrosis secondary to disruption of the posterior end
                                    arterial supply to the trochlea of the humerus<sup>5,87,106,167</sup> (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-28</span>). This approach is not

                        <h4>Type I (Nondisplaced)</h4>
                            <p>Simple immobilization at 60 to 90 degrees of elbow flexion, with the forearm in neutral
                                rotation is all that is necessary.<sup>164</sup> If there is unequivocally no significant swelling about the
                                elbow, a circumferential cast may be used; with significant swelling, initial splinting may be
                                best. Caregivers are educated on elevation and the signs and symptoms of compartment
                                syndrome. The elbow should not be flexed greater than 90 degrees. Using Doppler
                                examination of the brachial artery after supracondylar fractures, Mapes and
                                Hennrikus<sup>103</sup> found that flow was decreased in the brachial artery in positions of pronation
                                and increased flexion. Before the splint is applied, it should be confirmed that the pulse is
                                intact and that there is good capillary refill with the amount of elbow flexion intended during
                                immobilization.</p>
                            <p>X-rays are obtained 3 to 7 days after fracture to document lack of displacement. If there is
                                evidence of significant distal fragment extension, as judged by lack of intersection of the
                                AHL with the capitellum, the fracture should be treated with closed reduction and
                                percutaneous pinning to secure the reduction.</p>
                            <p>An acceptable position is determined by the AHL transecting the capitellum on the lateral xray,
                                a Baumann's angle of greater than 10 degrees or equal to the other side, and an intact
                                olecranon fossa. The duration of immobilization for supracondylar fractures is 3 weeks,
                                whether type I, II, or III. In general, no physical therapy is required after this injury. Patients
                                may be seen 4 to 6 weeks after immobilization is removed to ensure that ROM and strength
                                are returning normally. As the outcome in type I fractures is predictably excellent if
                                alignment is maintained at the time of early healing, follow-up visits are optional depending
                                on family and medical circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Remember that the initial x-ray is a static representation of the actual injury that may involve
                                soft tissue disruption much greater than one might expect from the minimal bony
                                abnormality. Excessive swelling, nerve or vascular disruption, or excessive pain are
                                indicative of a more significant injury that a type I fracture, in which case periosteal
                                disruption, may render this fracture inherently unstable. Also, beware of any medial
                                comminution that could allow the fracture to collapse into varus during immobilization.</p>
                        <h4>Type II Fracture (Hinged Posteriorly, With Posterior Cortex in Continuity)</h4>
                            <p>The optimal treatment of type II fractures has evolved to the current trend of operative
                                intervention with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning rather than cast immobilization.
                                The fracture is reduced with flexion, the reduction is confirmed with AP, lateral and oblique
                                fluoroscopy, and two lateral pins are placed<sup data-src="13_137.pdf" class="reference">137</sup><sup>,</sup><sup data-src="13_148.pdf" class="reference">148</sup><sup>,150</sup> through the distal humeral fragment,
                                engaging the opposite cortex of the proximal fragment (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-29</span>; see <span class="figure_num">Figs. 13-4</span> and <span class="figure_num">13-
                                17C,D</span>) (see Closed Reduction and Pinning). This is generally sufficient fixation, though in
                                many series three pins are often used.<sup>148</sup> The posterior cortex and intact periosteum provide
                                some degree of inherent stability. Cross-pinning of a type II fracture is generally not needed.
                                The pins are left protruding through the skin and are removed at 3 weeks after fixation,
                                generally without the need for sedation or anesthesia.</p>

                                On the AP view, there should be maximal pin separation at the fracture site, the pins should

                            <h5>Casting Versus CRPP of Type II Supracondylar Fractures of the Distal Humerus</h5>
                                <p>The distal humerus provides 20% of the growth of the humerus and thus has little remodeling
                                    potential. The upper limb grows approximately 10 cm during the first year, 6 cm during the
                                    second year, 5 cm during the third year, 3.5 cm during the fourth year, and 3 cm during the
                                    fifth year of life.<sup>42</sup> In toddlers (&lt;3 years), some remodeling potential is present, so the
                                    surgeon may accept nonoperative treatment of a type II fracture in which the capitellum
                                    abuts the AHL but does not cross it. In a child who is 8 to 10 years old, however, there is
                                    only 10% of growth of the distal humerus remaining, so adequate reduction and stabilization
                                    is essential to prevent malunion.</p>
                                <p>Three studies support the initial treatment of type II fractures with closed reduction and
                                    casting. Hadlow et al.<sup>66</sup> make the point that pinning all type II fractures in their series of
                                    initial closed reduction and casting meant that 77% (37 of 48) of patients would have
                                    undergone an unnecessary operative procedure. However, 23% (11 of 48) of the patients in
                                    that series lost reduction following closed reduction and underwent delayed operative
                                    fixation. Fourteen percent (2 of 14) that were followed had a poor outcome by Flynn
                                    criteria.<sup>53</sup> A retrospective review of 25 elbows treated with closed reduction and casting by
                                    Parikh et al.<sup>119</sup> showed a 28% (7 of 25) loss of reduction, 20% (5 of 25) need for delayed
                                    surgery, and 2% (2 of 25) unsatisfactory outcome according to Flynn criteria.</p>
                                <p>Similarly, Fitzgibbons et al.<sup>49</sup> reported 20% lost reduction in the closed treatment of 61 type
                                    II fractures. They noted that failure was more likely to occur in more displaced fractures in
                                    which the AHL did not touch the capitellum, and in those children with wider upper arms.
                                    They concluded that “a reasonable protocol” would involve urgent pinning of fractures in
                                    which the capitellum extends beyond the AHL, whereas fractures that are less displaced
                                    could undergo reduction and casting and then be followed at 1-week intervals.<sup>49</sup> In a series of
                                    155 type II SCH fractures treated nonoperatively, Camus et al.<sup>26</sup> reported that fractures were
                                    found to have radiographic evidence of sagittal plane (80% with abnormal AHL, decreased
                                    humerocapitellar angle), coronal plane (47% with abnormal Baumann's angle), and rotational
                                    (44%) deformities. An additional consideration when treating SCH fractures nonsurgically is
                                    the likelihood of the child following up with an orthopedic surgeon soon enough for a loss of
                                    reduction to be rereduced. Fletcher et al.<sup>51</sup> reported that children with supracondylar fractures
                                    seen at a large urban hospital in the United States were almost three times less likely to be
                                    seen back in clinic if they had public insurance or no insurance.</p>
                                <p>In contrast to the frequent loss of fixation from casting and reduction of type II fractures,
                                    closed reduction and percutaneous pinning has predictably good results. A consecutive series
                                    of 69 children with type II fractures treated with closed reduction and pinning reported no
                                    radiographic or clinical loss of reduction, no cubitus varus, no hyperextension, and no loss of
                                    motion. There were no iatrogenic nerve palsies, and no patient required additional
                                    surgery.<sup>148</sup> In another study of type II fractures, 189 consecutive cases of closed reduction
                                    and percutaneous pinning were reviewed. There were 2% (4/189) pin-tract infections, of
                                    which three were treated successfully with oral antibiotics and pin removal 1.5% (3/191) and
                                    one (0.5%) underwent operative irrigation and debridement for a wound infection not
                                    involving the joint. There were no nerve or vascular injuries, and no loss of reduction,
                                    delayed unions, or malunions. The authors conclude that pinning type II supracondylar
                                    fractures leads to a high probability of satisfactory outcome compared with previous studies
                                    of closed reduction without pinning.<sup>152</sup></p>
                                <p>Another reason for advocating operative treatment of these injuries is that the amount of
                                    hyperflexion needed to maintain reduction in unpinned type II fractures would predispose
                                    these patients to increased compartment pressures.<sup>16</sup> A study by Mapes and
                                    Hennrikus<sup>103</sup> showed that a pulse was lost to Doppler when type II fractures are flexed more
                                    than 110 degrees and type III fractures are flexed more than 70 degrees. Pronation also
                                    decreased flow in the brachial artery. Pinning these fractures obviates the need for
                                    immobilization with considerable elbow flexion. To truly stabilize an extension fracture
                                    treated closed, greater than 120 degrees of flexion is required.<sup>85</sup> The basic concept is that any
                                    fracture that would require elbow flexion greater than 90 degrees to hold reduction increases
                                    the risk of neurovascular compromise and therefore, should instead have the reduction held
                                    by pins, and immobilized with the elbow in less flexion (usually about 45 to 70 degrees).</p>
                        <h4>Type III Fractures</h4>
                            <p>The standard of care in most modern centers for the treatment of type III fractures is
                                operative reduction and pinning. In most series,<sup>3,85,124</sup> the results of type III fractures treated
                                with closed reduction and cast immobilization are not as good as those treated with pinning.
                                Hadlow et al.,<sup>66</sup> reported only 61% of type III and 77% of type II fractures were successfully
                                treated without pinning. It must be emphasized that flexion of the elbow with a type III
                                supracondylar fracture up to 90 degrees or greater significantly increases the risk of
                                compartment syndrome and should rarely, if ever, be done if modern operative facilities and
                                an experienced surgeon are available. Type III fractures are more likely than type to lose
                                reduction and require return to surgery by one report.<sup>114</sup></p>
                            <h5>Posteromedial Versus Posterolateral Displacement of Extension-Type Supracondylar
                                Fractures of the Distal Humerus</h5>
                                <p>The periosteum plays a key role with regard to treatment. With extension-type injuries, the
                                    anterior periosteum is likely torn. The intact posterior periosteal hinge provides stability to
                                    the fracture and facilitates reduction with a flexion reduction maneuver. Many authors have
                                    described adding forearm pronation to assist in reduction, but this should not be automatic.
                                    The direction of fracture displacement often indicates whether the medial or lateral
                                    periosteum remains intact. With a posteromedially displaced fracture, the medial periosteum
                                    is usually intact. Elbow flexion and forearm pronation places the medial and posterior
                                    periosteum on tension, which corrects varus and extension malalignment and adds to stability
                                    of fracture reduction (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-30</span>). The medial periosteum, however, is often torn in a
                                    posterolaterally displaced fracture, in which case pronation may be counterproductive.
                                    Instead, in a posterolaterally displaced supracondylar fracture, forearm supination in addition
                                    to flexion may be better because the lateral periosteum is usually intact (<span class="figure_num">Table 13-3</span>). If the
                                    posterior periosteal hinge is also disrupted, the fracture becomes unstable in both flexion and
                                    extension and this has been described as a multidirectionally unstable, modified Gartland
                                    type IV fracture.<sup>97</sup></p>

                        <h4>The Special Case of Medial Column Comminution</h4>
                            <p>Fractures with medial comminution may not have the dramatic displacement of most type III
                                fractures, but must be treated with operative reduction because collapse of the medial column
                                will lead to varus deformity in an otherwise minimally displaced supracondylar fracture
                                (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-23</span>). De Boeck et al.<sup>37</sup> recommended closed reduction with percutaneous pinning
                                when a fracture had medial comminution even in otherwise minimally displaced fractures, to
                                prevent cubitus varus. In this retrospective review, none of the six patients with medial
                                comminution who underwent operative fixation had cubitus varus whereas four of seven
                                (57%) patients who were treated nonoperatively developed cubitus varus.</p>
                            <p>The technique for reduction of a medial comminuted fracture is significant valgus force
                                applied across a straight elbow. Often, so much force is required that one is fearful of
                                creating a new fracture. Well-placed lateral entry pins are sufficient to hold the reduction.</p>
                            <h5>Open Fractures</h5>
                                <p>Open supracondylar fractures generally have an anterior puncture wound where the
                                    metaphyseal spike penetrates the skin (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-31</span>). Even if the open wound is only a small
                                    puncture in the center of an anterior pucker, open irrigation and debridement are indicated.
                                    The anterior approach, using a transverse incision based on the open wound with medial or
                                    lateral extension as needed, is recommended. The neurovascular bundle (NVB) is usually
                                    directly under the skin and tented over the metaphyseal fragment, so care should be taken in
                                    approaching this fracture surgically. The skin incision can be extended medially proximally
                                    (to follow the brachial artery and median nerve) and laterally distally if needed. However,
                                    usually only the transverse portion of the incision is required, which gives a better aesthetic
                                    result. The brachialis muscle is usually transected because it is a muscle belly to its insertion
                                    on the coronoid attachment and is highly vulnerable to trauma from the proximal
                                    metaphyseal fragment. The fracture surfaces are examined and washed, and a curette is used
                                    to remove any dirt or entrapped soft tissue. Once the debridement and washing are complete,
                                    the fracture is reduced by mobilizing the periosteum out of the way and flexing the distal
                                    humerus. Stabilization is with K-wires. All patients with open fractures are also treated with
                                    antibiotics: generally, cefazolin for Gustilo type I, II, and IIIA injuries, with the addition of
                                    appropriate antibiotics to cover gram-negative organisms for type IIIB and C fractures.</p>

                                <p>The patient is positioned supine on the operating table, with the fractured elbow on a short
                                    radiolucent arm board.<sup>148</sup> Some surgeons use the wide end of the fluoroscopy unit as the
                                    table, which is probably fine for type II fractures, but this setup will not allow for rotation of
                                    the fluoroscopy unit to obtain lateral images of the elbow which is useful in very unstable
                                    fractures, such as type IV. It is essential that the child's arm is far enough onto the arm board
                                    that the elbow can be well visualized with fluoroscopy. In very small children, this may
                                    mean having the child's shoulder and head on the arm board (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-33</span>).</p>

                                    enough to reach the center of the fluoroscopy unit.
                                    By placing the child's head in the crack between the operating room table and the arm board,
                                    the elbow is more easily imaged, and the child's head is unlikely to be inadvertently pulled
                                    off the side of the bed during the procedure.

                                    Verify four points to check for a good reduction: (1) the AHL intersects the capitellum (<span class="figure_num">Fig.

                                    medial and lateral columns are intact on oblique views (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 13-38</span>). We will accept some
                                    translation of the distal fragment (up to perhaps 5 mm), as long as the above criteria are met.
