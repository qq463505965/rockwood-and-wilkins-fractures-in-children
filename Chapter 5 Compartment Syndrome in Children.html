            <h1 id="5.1">INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Compartment syndrome (CS) in children is caused by sustained increased pressures within
                    an fascial compartment resulting in circulatory compromise, ischemia, and ultimately tissue
                    death. The importance of timely diagnosis and surgical intervention is critical to optimize
                    clinical outcomes. Failure to address CS in an expeditious manner can lead to permanent
                    disability in the affected limb.</p>
            <h1 id="5.2">DIAGNOSIS</h1>
                <p>A variety of injuries and medical conditions, including fractures, elective orthopedic
                    procedures such as osteotomies, soft tissue injuries, burn eschar, animal and insect bites,
                    external compression by tight dressings or casts, excessive flexion in a long-arm cast,
                    intravenous infiltration, antishock garments, infection (Group B strep), and bleeding
                    disorders can lead to CS and can involve the forearm, hand, thigh, leg and foot (<span class="figure_num">Table 5-1</span>).
                    The most common cause of CS is trauma, secondary to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and
                    sports.<sup>15</sup> Similar to adults, CS is up to four times more prevalent in boys than in girls.<sup>2</sup> The
                    diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is challenging and can be more difficult in
                    children, and particularly in infants. Additionally, a high index of suspicion must be
                    maintained in obtunded or sedated patients.</p>
                <p><span class="emphasize_1">The <i>six Ps</i>, including <i>pain, pressure, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness</i></span> have
                    been described as clinical markers of CS. The reliability of these clinical findings is
                    questionable; however, as they may be difficult to obtain in the pediatric or obtunded patient
                    or in a patient with delayed presentation in whom irreversible tissue damage has already
                    occurred. Instead, in children, the <span class="emphasize_1"><i>three As</i></span> may be more useful in making a diagnosis of CS
                    in the pediatric population: <span class="emphasize_1"><i>anxiety</i></span> (or restlessness), <span class="emphasize_1"><i>agitation</i></span> (or crying), and an
                    increasing <span class="emphasize_1"><i>analgesia</i></span> requirement.<sup>2</sup></p>

                <br />
                <p>Pain out of proportion to the injury, especially aggravated by passive motion of the ischemic
                    compartment, is a sensitive and early physical finding of CS.<sup>25</sup> An increasing analgesia
                    requirement, both in dose and frequency, is also a helpful early marker in children.<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>In unclear clinical presentations, compartment pressure measurements are recommended. In
                    the pediatric setting, compartment pressures are best measured under conscious sedation or
                    anesthesia. Multiple measurements at different sites and depths within each compartment are
                    recommended. Compartment pressure measurements close to the level of fracture may be
                    most accurate. Historically, the threshold for lower leg fasciotomies in both adults and
                    children were <span class="emphasize_1">an absolute pressure greater than 30 mm Hg</span> or <span class="emphasize_1">pressures within 30 mmHg of
                    either the diastolic blood pressure or the mean arterial pressure</span>. Application of this threshold
                    to children may not be appropriate. Baseline compartment pressures have been shown to be
                    higher in children compared to adults: normal adult leg compartment pressures are between
                    <span class="emphasize_1">5.2 and 9.7 mmHg</span>, whereas in children they are <span class="emphasize_1">13.3 to 16.6 mmHg</span>.<sup>36</sup> Also, children have
                    been shown to tolerate compartment pressures above traditional thresholds for fasciotomies,
                    and many do not develop ACS without surgical treatment. A prospective study identified 41
                    children with fractured forearms. Of these patients, 15 had needle manometry compartment
                    pressure readings >30 mm Hg in the injured extremity. Only 1 in 15 went on to develop
                    ACS. All the remaining children tolerated pressures greater than 30 mm Hg without
                    developing ACS. Authors argue that traditional surgical cutoff pressure measurements may
                    not apply to children, and that children may be closely observed and may ultimately avoid
                    the need for fasciotomies.<sup>40</sup> We recommend serial evaluation of the at-risk extremity and
                    decompressive fasciotomy when there are clinical signs of ACS development and elevated
                    compartment pressure readings.</p>
                <p>Risk factors that may delay diagnosis are altered level of consciousness, associated nerve
                    injury, polytrauma, and altered pain perception. Delay in diagnosis may also be related to
                    longer elapsed time between the initial injury and peak compartment pressures in the
                    pediatric setting.<sup>13</sup> Extended close monitoring after injury is recommended when there is
                    concern for development of CS in children. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a rarely
                    used noninvasive method that measures oxygenation in at-risk tissues and has been shown to
                    reliably estimate tissue intracompartmental pressure.<sup>7,34</sup></p>
            <h1 id="5.3">CLASSIFICATION</h1>
                <p><i style="font-weight:bold;">Acute Compartment Syndrome</i>: ACS occurs when tissue pressures rise high enough within an
                    fascial compartment to cause tissue ischemia. The exact time of onset of ACS is difficult to
                    determine and varies by patient.</p>
                <p><i style="font-weight:bold;">Fracture ACS</i>: The majority of cases of CS are associated with a fracture. Both high- and
                    low-energy injuries can result in CS. Open fractures are associated with a higher incidence of
                    CS than closed injuries.<sup>15</sup> Open fractures are generally associated with higher-energy injuries
                    and the associated fascial disruption does not result in adequate decompression of all
                    compartments.</p>
                <p><i style="font-weight:bold;">Nonfracture ACS</i>: Soft tissue injury without fracture can also lead to CS, especially in the
                    setting of an underlying bleeding disorder or with the use of anticoagulants.</p>
                <p><i style="font-weight:bold;">Exercise-Induced or Exertional CS</i>: Exercise-induced CS is a transient increased
                    compartment pressure and reversible tissue ischemia caused by a noncompliant fascial
                    compartment that does not accommodate muscle expansion occurring during a repetitive
                    exercise such as running.</p>
                <p><i style="font-weight:bold;">Neonatal</i>: Neonatal CS has been reported. To our knowledge, it has only been reported in the
                    upper extremity and is characterized by skin lesions that can be confused with other
                    diagnoses. Due to this, diagnosis is usually delayed and patients develop Volkmann's
                    contracture, as well as bone and nerve disturbances.<sup>28</sup> Early recognition and treatment can
                    improve the functional outcome and growth; however, established neonatal Volkmann's
                    contracture cannot be improved by emergent intervention.</p>
            <h1 id="5.4">TREATMENT</h1>
                <p>Potentially devastating complications of CS may be avoidable with early recognition and
                    prompt intervention. The goal of treatment is to prevent tissue necrosis, neurovascular
                    compromise, and permanent functional deficits.</p>
                <p>The first step is to remove all possible extrinsic causes of pressure on the affected limb,
                    including circumferential dressings, cast padding, and casts.Authors
                    argue that in patients with ACS, the affected extremity should not be dependent, but also
                    should not be elevated higher than the patient's heart to maximize perfusion while
                    minimizing swelling.</p>
                <p>If the diagnosis of CS is made, emergent fasciotomy, that is, release of the fascia overlying
                    each affected compartment is necessary. At times, release of the epimysium is also
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>In the case of a delayed CS where there is no demonstrable muscle function in any segment
                    of the involved limb, the limb can be splinted in a functional position. Fasciotomy is not
                    indicated. For the upper extremity, if resources are available for immediate reconstruction
                    with functional free muscle transfer, then early debridement and reconstruction can reduce 
                    the incidence of late contracture and can improve neurologic recovery.<sup>32,37</sup> Supportive care,
                    usually in the form of vigorous intravenous hydration, should be given for the potential risk
                    of myoglobinuria. Myoglobinuria, as well as metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia, can also
                    occur during reperfusion and requires medical management to prevent sequelae such as renal
                    failure, shock, hypothermia, and cardiac arrhythmias and/or failure.</p>
            <h1 id="5.5">UPPER EXTREMITY</h1>
                <p>In the upper extremity, ACS most commonly involves the forearm and is typically associated
                    with both bone fractures of the forearm and supracondylar fracture of the
                    humerus.<sup>5,13,15,18</sup> The incidence of forearm CS following upper extremity injuries has been
                    estimated at 1%.<sup>15</sup> High-risk fracture patterns include displaced SCH fractures with
                    concomitant ipsilateral forearm fractures. In this case, the rate of CS is as high as
                    33%.<sup>5</sup> Additionally, SCH fractures with a median nerve injury are at high risk for CS, as the
                    pain of CS is masked.<sup>24</sup> Other risk factors for developing CS after intramedullary nailing of
                    forearm fractures include open fractures, longer intraoperative and fluoroscopic times, and
                    younger age (mean age 6 compared to 10 years).<sup>4,22,46</sup></p>
                <p>The surgical incision for fasciotomy of the arm and forearm is extensile from the brachium to
                    the carpal tunnel. The extent of the release performed is tailored to the clinical and
                    intraoperative findings. Release of the dorsal forearm and compartments of the hand requires
                    separate incisions when indicated (<span class="figure_num">Table 5-2</span>). Separate incisions for dermatomes of each
                    finger may also be added to prevent skin necrosis and loss of fingers.</p>

                    <p>The anterior and posterior compartments of the arm can be decompressed through a single

                        posterior incision may be used to separately decompress the anterior and posterior
                        compartments.

                <h2 id="5.5.2">Forearm</h2>
                    <p>Several skin incisions have been described for the forearm. Since the surgical incisions are
                        long and extensile, almost any incision can be used to decompress the forearm compartments
                        (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 5-2</span>). Because the incisions are left open, we prefer the incision described in <span class="figure_num">Figure 5-
                        3C,D</span> over the incision seen in <span class="figure_num">Figure 5-3 A,B</span>, as this minimizes exposure of neurovascular
                        structures and can be extended proximally into the medial arm and distally into the carpal
                        tunnel (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 5-3C,D</span>).<sup>33</sup> After the skin incision is made, the antebrachial fascia is opened
                        longitudinally from lacertus fibrosus to the wrist flexion crease. This decompresses the
                        superficial flexor compartment. The deep flexor compartment is most easily and safely
                        exposed through the ulnar side of the forearm.<sup>29</sup> Start at the mid to distal forearm and identify
                        the interval between flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum superficialis. The flexor
                        digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus fascia are exposed and released through this
                        interval. This is the most important component of this procedure, as the deep flexor
                        compartment is usually the first and most affected by increased compartmental pressure.
                        Through the same interval, the fascia overlying the pronator quadratus is also released.</p>

                        an incision over the radial or ulnar artery or median nerve. The deep flexor compartment is
                        best released by opening the interval between flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor digitorum
                        superficialis.

                    <p>During the dissection, if the muscles appear pale after release of the fascia, then additional
                        release of the epimysium of the pale muscle should be performed. For these muscles,
                        reperfusion injury will lead to more swelling in the muscle that will lead to further muscle
                        injury if the epimysium is not released.</p>
                    <p>Clinical evaluation at this time of the remaining tension in the dorsal forearm compartment
                        and/or hand should be done to determine whether additional release of the extensor
                        compartments and hand should be added. The extensor compartments are released through a
                        midline longitudinal dorsal incision extending from the lateral epicondyle to the distal
                        radioulnar joint. This will allow release of the mobile wad and the extensor compartment

                        <p>Decompression should start with an extended carpal tunnel release. This will usually
                            adequately release Guyon's canal without formally opening and decompressing the ulnar
                            neurovascular structures. The carpal tunnel incision can be extended to the volar second web
                            space. In the distal portion of the incision, the volar fascia of the adductor pollicis muscle can
                            be released. Also, the fascia tracking to the long finger metacarpal (separating the deep radial
                            and ulnar midpalmar space) can be decompressed. This will help decompress the volar
                            interosseous muscles.The thenar and hypothenar muscles are decompressed through separate
                            incisions as needed (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 5-8A,C</span>).</p>
