            <h1 id="3.1">INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Despite wide changes in adult trauma, cast and splint methodology is still
                    used with great frequency in the management of pediatric trauma. In children, requisite
                    attention to perfect reduction and extensive immobilization is not needed because of the
                    rapidity of fracture healing and the remodeling potential seen in children. Over 90% of adult
                    forearm fractures are treated with surgery; <span class="emphasize_1">in children, 90% of forearm fractures are treated
                    with reduction and cast immobilization</span>.</p>
            <h1 id="3.2">PAIN MANAGEMENT AND SEDATION FOR FRACTURE MANAGEMENT</h1>
                <p>In normally sensate children, reduction and immobilization of fractures is always associated
                    with pain and anxiety.This setting is ideal as it allows the orthopedist to focus completely
                    on the fracture without worrying about the safety of the child, without the distractions of a
                    suffering child, and with parents looming in the background.Yet one should consider reduction and cast application in the operating
                    room for children with autistic spectrum disorders; children with medical comorbidities that
                    preclude safe sedation in the emergency department; and in cases of fractures which could be
                    very difficult to reduce (significant displacement and swelling) and will likely need operative
                    stabilization anyway.</p>
                <p>Procedural sedation methods include different routes of drug delivery (<span class="emphasize_1">intranasal</span>, <span class="emphasize_1">IV</span>, or
                    <span class="emphasize_1">inhalational</span>) and can utilize differing combinations of agents. Although not an exhaustive
                    list; a contemporary listing of systemic drugs used for these injuries include combinations of
                    etomidate, ketamine, narcotics, midazolam, propofol, and nitrous oxide.<sup>1,9,49,54,72</sup></p>
            <h1 id="3.3">GENERAL</h1>
                <p>Because of the growth and remodeling potential of pediatric bones, acceptable alignment
                    rather than exact anatomic reduction is sufficient for many fractures, allowing the majority of
                    pediatric fractures to be managed in a cast. Similarly, joint stiffness is not typically a longterm
                    problem in children treated in a cast.<sup>7</sup> The goals of pediatric cast treatment are to protect
                    and provide stability to the broken bone, maintain alignment, and protect from further injury
                    until sufficient healing has occurred. In general, the alignment maintained in the cast should
                    allow the child to eventually remodel to anatomic “normal” by the cessation of growth. 
                    The younger the child, the more malalignment may be acceptable. Likewise, deformity closer to
                    the growth plate and in the plane of motion will typically remodel more than those
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The duration of cast treatment is both age and site specific. Very young children, infants, and
                    newborns will generally heal fractures quicker than adolescents. In general, fractures of the
                    hands and feet require <span class="emphasize_1">4 weeks</span> of immobilization; elbow fractures <span class="emphasize_1">3 to 6 weeks</span>; tibial shaft
                    fractures may take <span class="emphasize_1">12 to 16 weeks</span>, whereas most other fractures require <span class="emphasize_1">6 weeks</span>. Before
                    discontinuing cast immobilization, fracture healing should be documented on radiographs
                    and the child should be nontender at the fracture site.</p>
                <p>In general, casts are utilized to <span class="emphasize_1">maintain</span> alignment. If a fracture is nondisplaced or has an
                    acceptable alignment, the cast's purpose is to keep the child comfortable and maintain that
                    alignment until the bone has healed. If a fracture has an unacceptable alignment, it should be
                    reduced to an acceptable alignment and the cast placed to maintain that alignment. Fractures
                    that should be treated operatively include injuries in which adequate alignment or length
                    cannot be easily obtained or maintained, displaced intra-articular fractures, and many
                    fractures involving the physis. Postoperatively, the limb may be protected with a splint or a
                    cast if necessary. Problems may arise when a cast is used <span style="background-color:red;color: white;"><s>toobtain</s></span> acceptable alignment.
                    Pressure sores and soft tissue injuries have been documented when casts are used in this
                    manner and should be done so with caution.<sup>43,56,74</sup></p>
                <p>To minimize motion at the fracture site, casts are placed to span the joint proximal, distal, or
                    both. In general, the more proximal a fracture, the more likely joints at each end of the bone
                    will be spanned. Increasing the length of the cast increases the resistance to rotation.<sup>42</sup> To
                    maintain correct alignment, limbs may be casted in different positions to counteract specific
                    displacing forces on the proximal or distal fragment of a given fracture. For example, in a
                    subtrochanteric femur fracture, the proximal fragment is pulled into flexion, abduction, and
                    external rotation by attached muscles, so the distal fragment must be positioned with this in
                    mind. The distal fragment must be brought into a position of flexion to match the flexed
                    proximal femur from pull of the psoas muscle.</p>
                <h2 id="3.3.1">Cast Complications</h2>
                    <p>Although casting is often viewed as “conservative” treatment, the treating physician and
                        family should recognize that this does not imply that this treatment is without complications.
                        This implies that many physicians and patients may expect cast
                        immobilization to be without risk. Thus, it is important to inform patients and their
                        caregivers of the risks associated with cast treatment. For instance, a child with a tibia
                        fracture can be told to expect pain in the pretibial area but they should also be aware that pain
                        in other locations (such as over the point of the heal) is not fracture related and may imply an
                        impending heel sore. When the expectations of cast immobilization are explained and risks
                        of treatment are given, it is beneficial that these risks be written and delivered to the patient
                        and their family.<sup>39</sup></p>
                    <h3>The Wet and Soiled Cast</h3>
                        <p>Wet casts that are not made with synthetic material and waterproof liners (and thus can dry
                            quickly) should be changed. Failure to do so may result in skin irritation, breakdown, and
                            possible infection.A frankly wet cast or cast padding that cannot be dried as described above
                            usually requires inspection of the skin and cast change (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-1</span>).<sup>52</sup>
                            Hip spica
                            casts are often applied in the operating room and their removal and exchange at times require
                            a general anesthetic. Parents should be well instructed on positioning to avoid soiling,
                            frequent diaper changes, and inspecting the children for skin irritation. Anesthetic risks must
                            be weighed with the perceived soft tissue and skin risk.</p>

                            Orthopaedics.)</p>
                    <h3>Thermal Injury</h3>
                        <p>Plaster and fiberglass, the two most common casting materials, harden through exothermic
                            chemical reactions. Plaster has a much higher setting temperature than fiberglass and
                            therefore a higher risk for thermal injury when a cast is placed. Two factors strongly
                            associated with thermal injuries are dip water temperature and the thickness of cast material.
                            Several studies have shown that risk of thermal injury is significant if the dip water
                            temperature is too hot (&gt;50°C) or if the casts are too thick (&gt;24 ply).<sup>30,36,45</sup>
                            Those patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia may be at increased risk as they will not
                            report burning pain that is associated with thermal injury.</p>
                    <h3>Areas of Focal Pressure: Impending Pressure Sores</h3>
                        <p>A key to preventing loss of fracture reduction is in the application of a well-molded cast.
                            Cast padding should be applied between 3 and 5 layers thick over the limb being
                            casted.<sup>55,66</sup> Bony prominences (heel, malleoli, patella, ASIS, and olecranon) and cast edges
                            should be additionally padded to prevent irritation yet allow a cast to be molded to fit snugly
                            without undue pressure. The use of foam padding in such areas may help decrease the
                            incidence of pressure sores.<sup>28</sup></p>
                        <p>Any patient with a
                            suspected foreign body down their cast should have the cast removed and skin inspected
                            (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-2</span>).</p>

                    <h3>Detecting Cast Complications</h3>
                        <p>That “there are no hypochondriacs in casts” is an important aphorism to remember and every
                            effort should be taken to resolve the source of complaint in an immobilized patient.</p>
                        <p>Certain pediatric patients may be at a higher risk for cast complications. These include the
                            very young, developmentally delayed, or patients under anesthesia or sedation who may have
                            difficulty responding to noxious stimuli such as heat or pressure during the cast application.
                            Discerning problems in this group may be quite difficult and cast sores can occur despite
                            appropriate and careful application.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, patients with impaired sensation are at increased risk for injuries related to
                            excessive heat and pressure. In this group are those with spinal cord
                            injuries,<sup>60,67</sup>myelomeningocele,<sup>51</sup> and systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus.<sup>34</sup> Patients
                            with CP are at increased risk for complications due to communication difficulties and poor
                            nutrition, in addition to their spasticity.<sup>47,68</sup></p>
                <h2 id="3.3.2">Treating Cast Complications</h2>
                    <h3 id="3.3.2.1">Dermatitis</h3>
                        <p>The majority of dermatitis under casts has to do with maceration of the skin and continued
                            contact with wetness including fluids such as urine or feces. Often, removal of the cast,
                            cleansing of the skin, and allowing the skin to “dry out” is all that is required. Some
                            recommend applying over-the-counter skin moisturizers.<sup>24</sup> If fungal infection is suspected,
                            half-strength nystatin cream and 1% hydrocortisone cream may be applied, followed by
                            miconazole powder dusting twice daily.<sup>24</sup> If unstable, the fracture may be managed by a
                            newly applied dry split cast or splint allowing time for the skin to recover. In rare cases,
                            internal or external fixation may be chosen to manage the fracture and to allow treatment of
                            the skin issues. Often, the skin will improve dramatically after a few days and a new cast
                            may be applied. If significant concern for cellulitis exists, such as induration or fevers,
                            laboratory tests should be ordered and empiric oral antibiotics prescribed.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.2.2">Pressure Sores</h3>
                        <p>Pressure sores are the result of a focal area of pressure, which exceeds perfusion pressure.
                            Although there may be initial pain associated with this pressure, this can be difficult to
                            separate from the pain of the fracture or surgery. Any pain away from the injured area should
                            be suspected to have a problem with focal pressure. The heel is the most common site. These
                            sores may vary from areas of erythema, to black eschars, to full-thickness soft tissue loss and
                            exposed bone (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-3</span>). In the benign cases, removal of the cast over the heel and either
                            cessation or careful reapplication is all that is necessary. Typically, black eschars imply
                            partial- to full-thickness injuries. If they are intact, nonfluctuant, nondraining, and mobile
                            from the underlying bone, they may be treated as a biologic dressing with weekly wound
                            checks. If any concern exists, a wound team and/or plastic surgery consult should be sought
                            earlier rather than later. Often, dressing changes using topical enzymatic ointments and
                            antibiotic ointments can be used to treat these wounds (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-4</span>). Whenever exposed bone is
                            present, osteomyelitis is a concern requiring aggressive intervention and possible intravenous
                            antibiotic therapy. In these severe cases, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy, skin
                            grafting, or flap coverage may be necessary.<sup>46</sup></p>

                        <p>Determination of cast immobilization duration is often multifactorial; however, the clinician
                            must recognize that unwanted physiologic changes may occur. Although these changes are
                            less pronounced in children than adults, excessive length of immobilization may lead to
                            problems such as stiffness,<sup>26</sup> muscle atrophy, cartilage degradation, ligament weakening, and
                            osteoporosis.<sup>7,14,15,35,69</sup> This must be weighed against the bony healing gained in prolonged
                            immobilizations. Alternatives such as Pavlik harness bracing for infants with femur
                            fractures,<sup>58</sup> patellar tendon bearing casts versus long-leg casts for tibial fractures, short-arm
                            casts for distal forearm fractures, and other functional braces may minimize some of the risks
                            of cast immobilization or at least decrease the duration of cast treatment.
                            The ankle, elbow, and fingers are often locations prone to stiffness. The duration of
                            immobilization should be minimized if at all possible.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.2.4">Compartment Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Most limbs with fresh fractures are more comfortable after immobilization. Therefore,
                            increasing pain or neurovascular change should be fully evaluated to detect the above
                            complications and possibly compartment syndrome. Fractures and surgery can result in
                            progressive soft tissue swelling that might not have been present at the time of cast
                            application and may lead to compartment syndrome. In this scenario,<sup>63</sup> the first intervention
                            should be relieving the circumferential pressure by splitting the cast and all underlying
                            padding, as leaving the padding intact has been shown to not fully relieve compartment
                            pressure. Should splitting the cast fail to alleviate symptoms, cast removal should be
                            considered. Fractures of the tibia,<sup>27,32</sup> forearm,<sup>32</sup> and elbow have increased risk of
                            compartment syndrome. High-energy fractures resulting from motor vehicle accidents, crush
                            injuries, or two-level injuries such as a floating elbow should raise the treating physician's
                            awareness to the possibility of an impending compartment syndrome. Any child unable to
                            detect pain associated with compartment syndrome (a nerve injury or regional anesthesia)
                            must be followed closely for the development of compartment syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Children do not usually exhibit the classical four Ps (pallor, paresthesias, pulseless, pain with
                            passive stretch) associated with compartment syndrome until myonecrosis may be starting.
                            Instead, the “three As” of increased agitation, anxiety, and analgesic requirements have been
                            documented as the earliest signs of compartment syndrome in children. Any child exhibiting
                            these symptoms that are not relieved with cast splitting should have the cast removed and
                            limb inspected with a high suspicion of compartment syndrome. One should be ready to take
                            the child to the operating room for formal compartment evaluation and decompression if
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>Fractures with associated neurovascular injuries are at significant risk of developing a
                            compartment syndrome and require frequent neurovascular checks. These limbs may be
                            stabilized with a splint as opposed to circumferential cast application, which could worsen
                            the risk of compartment syndrome. These limbs are most often treated with operative
                            stabilization using internal or external fixation and/or splint immobilization. This allows
                            continued neurovascular assessment, palpation of compartments, and inspection of the limb.
                            For instance, the child with a floating elbow fracture and associated nerve palsy (at high risk
                            for compartment syndrome) is usually best treated with internal fixation of the fractures, and
                            either a splint, bivalved cast that is easily opened, or cast with thick foam to allow for
                            swelling, with the volar forearm exposed to assess the compartments as well as the pulses.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.2.5">Disuse Osteopenia and Pathologic Fractures Adjacent to Cast</h3>
                        <p>Patients with paralytic conditions or cerebral palsy patients and those taking anticonvulsants
                            may experience further disuse osteopenia with immobilization.<sup>60,67</sup> These patients are at
                            significantly higher risk of pathologic fracture while casted or upon cast
                            removal.<sup>2,47</sup> Strategies to prevent this includes minimizing immobilization (&lt;4 weeks),
                            weight-bearing casts, and the use of less rigid immobilization such as Soft Cast (3M Health
                            Care Ltd., Loughborough, England) and splints and braces.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.2.6">Delayed Diagnosis of Wound Infections</h3>
                        <p>Many children are placed in postsurgical casts. The vast majority does well without incident.
                            However, casts over wounds or pins may cause a delay in the diagnosis of a wound infection
                            (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-5</span>). For instance, an estimated 1% to 4% of all pediatric supracondylar humerus
                            fractures treated with pinning the elbow will develop a postoperative pin-tract inflammation
                            or infection.<sup>4,26</sup> Therefore, unexplained fever beyond the perioperative period, increase in
                            pain at pin sites, foul smell, or discharge from a cast should be evaluated by a member of the
                            orthopedic team. The wound should be examined either with cast windowing or cast
                            removal. Laboratory tests including CBC, ESR, and CRP may be advisable. In cases of early
                            pin-site infection where the fracture is not yet healed, oral antibiotics may control the
                            infection long enough to allow more fracture healing prior to pin removal. Infections of pins
                            used for certain fractures may have a high chance of joint penetration (lateral condyle,
                            supracondylar Humerus, distal femoral physeal, and proximal humerus) and thus superficial
                            pin-tract infection could lead to a septic joint. This is much more serious than simple pin-site
                            infections, and most often must be treated with surgical irrigation and debridement and pin
                            removal should be considered despite the status of fracture healing.</p>

                <h2 id="3.3.3">Types of Casting Materials</h2>
                    <p>Before placing a cast, the limb must be inspected. Any dirt, operative skin prep, or jewelry
                        should be removed before the cast is applied. Often, appropriate size stockinette or liner is
                        applied against the skin, under the cast and cast padding. Although not essential, these liners
                        minimize skin irritation; allow nice well-padded and polished edges to the cast to be applied.
                        They also minimize the tendency of some children to “pick out” their cast padding. These
                        liners are made of cotton, water-friendly synthetic materials such as polyester, sliverimpregnated
                        cotton (to minimize bacterial growth), or Gore-Tex (W.L. Gore & Associates,
                        Inc.; Newark, DE). Some in the care of children who require spica cast application favor
                        water-permeable liners such as Gore-Tex. In addition to being more convenient for patients,
                        these newer materials minimize skin irritation.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.3.1">Cast Padding</h3>
                        <p>Different materials are used to pad the extremity between the cast material and the patient's
                            skin. A thin layer (3 to 5 layers) of padding is applied to the portion of the extremity that is
                            not prone to pressure sores and it is applied without wrinkles.<sup>55,66</sup> Additional layers may be
                            placed over bony prominences to minimize pressure in these areas. Cotton is the cheapest
                            and is historically most commonly used. But casts with cotton padding cannot be made
                            waterproof as the cotton padding retains water. Newer synthetic materials have variable
                            water resistance and when paired with fiberglass, can allow patients to bathe and swim.
                            However, these materials are considerably more expensive than their cotton counterparts. In
                            addition, some synthetic padding is less resistant to a cast saw. If one applies Gore-Tex
                            padding, the blue DE FLEX safety strip can be placed along the path that the cast saw will
                            take to remove the cast.</p>
                        <p>Cast edges are often a source of skin irritation and abrasion. This is especially true for
                            fiberglass casts. When making a cast, applying the stockinette and cast padding at least 1 cm
                            beyond the edge of the fiberglass, and folding the stockinette and padding back over the first
                            layer of fiberglass, will make a cast with well-padded edges. Closed-cell adhesive foam may
                            also be applied to the edges of a cast and to pad bony prominences. It is important to
                            recognize that some foam padding will accumulate moisture and will not be effectively
                            wicked away from the liner and skin. Should difficulty be found in folding back the
                            underlying stockinette or liner, the cast edges may be petaled with tape or moleskin adhesive.
                            This involves placing a 1- to 2-in piece of tape on the inside of the liner and folding the taped
                            liner over the opening of cast. Most commonly, petaling is performed on hip spica casts but
                            may be performed on any cast.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.3.2">Plaster of Paris</h3>
                        <p>Plaster-impregnated cloth is the time-tested form of immobilization. It was first described in
                            1852 and has been the gold standard for cast immobilization for many years. This material is
                            generally less expensive and is more moldable in comparison to the synthetic counterparts.
                            Beyond more accurate molding, other major advantages of plaster over synthetic materials in
                            the prevention of cast sores and limb compression are its increase in pliability and its
                            effective spreading after univalving. Inconveniences associated with plaster include its poor
                            resistance to water and its lower strength-to-weight ratio resulting in heavier (thicker) casts.
                            Plaster of Paris combines with water in a reaction that results in gypsum. In the process of
                            setting up, the conversion to gypsum is an exothermic reaction with thermal energy as a byproduct.
                            In general, the amount of heat produced is variable between each of the
                            manufactured plasters. However, within each product line, faster-setting plasters can be
                            expected to produce more heat. As the speed of the reaction, amount of reactants, or
                            temperature of the system (dip water and/or ambient temperature) increase; the amount of
                            heat given off can cause significant thermal injury.<sup>30,36,45</sup> The low strength-to-weight ratio
                            may also increase risk of thermal injury as those unfamiliar with the amount (ply) of plaster
                            to use may inadvertently use too much, resulting in a burn.</p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.3.3">Fiberglass</h3>
                        <p>More recently, synthetic fiberglass materials have been introduced. These materials have the
                            benefit of being lightweight and strong. In addition, these materials can be combined with
                            waterproof liners to allow patients to bathe and swim in their casts. These materials are often
                            more radiolucent, allowing better imaging within the cast.</p>
                        <p>Risk of thermal injury is much lower and is a major advantage over plaster.<sup>36</sup> However,
                            because of the increased stiffness, some feel these casts are more difficult to mold, whereas
                            others prefer fiberglass as the strength of the molded portion is greater. To prevent increased
                            areas of pressure and constriction of the limb, special precautions are recommended when
                            applying fiberglass rolls.<sup>21</sup> In addition, fiberglass is more expensive than plaster (can be more
                            than double). Finally, there may be a small long-term risk to those applying and removing
                            these materials. The carcinogenic risks in the manufacturing and use of fiberglass materials
                            are questioned.<sup>70</sup></p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.3.4">Other Casting Materials</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the standard rigid casting materials of plaster and fiberglass, a less rigid class
                            of nonfiberglass synthetic casting material is available. Although less rigid than standard
                            casting materials, this Soft Cast (3M Health Care Ltd., Loughborough, UK) has several
                            potential advantages. Experimental studies have shown that this material is more
                            accommodating to increases in pressure than the other casting materials.<sup>23</sup> As this material is
                            less rigid, it may be an ideal material to immobilize patients with severe osteopenia. Finally,
                            this material can be removed without using a cast saw, which eliminates the risk of cast saw
                            injury.<sup>11</sup></p>
                    <h3 id="3.3.3.5">Combination of Materials</h3>
                        <p>Some combine plaster and fiberglass casting materials in hopes of obtaining the best features
                            of both. One may reinforce a thin well-molded plaster cast by overwrapping it with fiberglass
                            to increase its durability and minimize its weight. With this technique, one must ensure that
                            the plaster has set before overwrapping with the fiberglass. Failure to do so may result in a
                            thermal injury.<sup>36</sup> Shortcomings of this technique include the fact that the two layers of
                            material may obscure fine radiographic detail. Finally, great care must be taken when
                            removing such casts as it may be difficult to “feel” the depth of the cast saw blade and blade
                            temperatures may be more elevated than usual. As a result of the increased risks of burns, it
                            may be particularly advantageous to use plastic protection strips under the cast when using a
                            standard vibrating cast saw for cast removal. Yet despite these shortcomings, fiberglass has
                            become the most popular casting material in most centers; this is because of the increased
                            strength, decreased weight, improved radiographic quality, color choices, and ability to make
                            water-friendly casts.</p>
                <h2 id="3.3.4">General Cast Application Principles</h2>
                    <p>While pain control and sedation are often required, techniques are needed for calming and
                        distracting a child during cast application. Speak with a soft voice, sitting and placing oneself
                        at a level at or below that of the child to present a less intimidating stature. Initial
                        examination techniques should be soft and distant from the site of concern, progressing
                        slowly to the area of concern.</p>
                    <p>Talking to the child and his parents helps identify the best approach for an individual child,
                        and use of child life specialists proves extremely helpful in implementing the preferred
                        approach.<sup>17,62</sup> For infants and toddlers, soft music, toys (especially those with lights or
                        moving parts), and some interactive applications on handheld devices help with distraction
                        and relaxation.<sup>50</sup> When using a cast saw for cutting the cast or cast removal, ear protection
                        helps decrease anxiety.<sup>13</sup> For children with cognitive, behavioral, or autistic spectrum
                        disorders, discussion of possible approaches with the parents reaps rewards as they have the
                        best sense of what will be calming, as well as stimulatory, for their child.</p>
                    <p>Plaster of Paris depends on excellent handling techniques to maximize the benefits of mold
                        ability and fit and also to maximize strength. Some like the plaster to be wet to mold better;
                        others will like a drier roll to ease application (less slippery) and speed the curing process. It
                        is optimal to keep the plaster roll in contact to the limb to avoid wrapping the material too
                        tight (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-6</span>). The plaster should be unrolled with overlaps of one-half to one-third the
                        width of the roll and tucks are taken to avoid the tendency of pulling and stretching the
                        material (thus increasing tightness) to get a good distribution and fit of the plaster around the
                        difficult concave areas of the ankle, knee, elbow, and thumb. The optimal cast technique
                        requires frequent rubbing and incorporation of the plaster rolls as the cast is being applied
                        (i.e., initial molding) and will improve the fit but will also flatten the tucks and incorporate
                        the mineral portion of the plaster into the fiber mesh for optimal strength. Plaster splints
                        should be dipped and vigorously molded together before applying to the convexity of the
                        limb (back of elbow or ankle) or where additional strength is needed (anterior knee [long-leg
                        cast] or posterior thigh [spica cast]).</p>

                    <p>Once the plaster cast is applied and the initial molding has been accomplished, the cast is
                        supported by broad surfaces such as the palm of a hand; the thorax of the surgeon is an
                        excellent broad surface to hold the plantar foot in neutral flexion and extension (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-7</span>).
                        Statically holding a cast with the tips of fingers as it dries will leave indentations that can
                        lead to pressure sores. If fingers are needed for molding, pressure should be applied and then
                        withdrawn as the plaster reaches the final curing at which point, terminal molding of the cast
                        can be done. Terminal molding is that point at which the plaster is fairly firm, somewhat
                        pliable and warm; yet can be gently deformed without cracking the Plaster of Paris. This is
                        the appropriate time to do the final mold and hold of fracture fragments. As the cast goes
                        through the final curing process, it can be supported on pillows, provided the cast is not too
                        hot (the pillow prevents heat loss and will increase the temperature at the skin surface). A leg
                        cast should be supported under the calf and allowing the heel to hang free (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-8</span>) and thus
                        prevent a gradual deformation of the heel into a point of internal skin pressure.</p>

                    <p>Fiberglass material is applied and molded in a slightly different manner and some believe its
                        material properties make it harder to apply and mold in comparison to Plaster of Paris.
                        Fiberglass material should be removed from its package and dipped in water just prior to
                        application as it will cure and harden in the air. Fiberglass is often tacky in nature and
                        therefore increased tension is needed to unroll the fiberglass, and can inadvertently result in a
                        cast that is circumferentially too tight. To avoid this, fiberglass should be applied in a stretch
                        relaxation manner<sup>21</sup>; the fiberglass roll is lifted off of the limb (in contradistinction to plaster
                        which stays in contact); unrolled first then wrapped around the limb (Fig. 3-9). Difficulty
                        exists when wrapping a wide roll into a concavity (anterior elbow or ankle) as the fiberglass
                        can only lay flat if pulled too tight. Small relaxing cuts in the fiberglass may be needed, as
                        fiberglass does not tuck as easily as Plaster of Paris. Fiberglass is not as exothermic as
                        Plaster of Paris and risk of burns is lower, yet the other principles of holding the cast as the
                        fiberglass cures is the same as in Plaster of Paris.</p>

                <h2 id="3.3.5">Cast Splitting</h2>
                    <p>Casts are cut and split to decrease the pressure the limb experiences after trauma or surgery.
                        In general, the more trauma (either from the trauma or the surgery performed) a limb
                        experiences, the more swelling that will ensue. Thus, minimally displaced fractures can often
                        be managed without splitting a cast, while those requiring a closed or open reduction may
                        initially need to be managed in a split cast or one padded with thick foam. Although splitting
                        may be done prophylactically or as symptoms develop, the experienced clinician will often
                        choose the former to avoid having to split the cast at a later time when the child is in pain,
                        crying, anxious, and usually in the middle of the night. When splitting a cast, one must
                        ensure that the plaster or fiberglass has set, that is hardened and cool, and that the blade
                        temperature remains cool throughout the splitting process. Attempting to split a plaster cast
                        before it is warm and hard (curing) or less than 10 minutes after application is more difficult
                        and prone to result in inadvertent skin touches.</p>
                    <p>The effect of cast splitting depends on the material used, how it was applied, and whether or
                        not the associated padding is split. Plaster cast cutting and spreading (univalve) can be
                        expected to decrease 40% to 60% of the pressure and release of padding may increase this by
                        10% to 20%.<sup>8,21,31,53</sup> Fiberglass casts applied without stretch relaxation are known to be two
                        times tighter than those applied with plaster<sup>21</sup> and in these cases, bivalving the fiberglass cast
                        would be needed to see similar decreases in pressure. Casts that are applied with the stretch
                        relaxation method are among the least constrictive of fiberglass casts and therefore
                        univalving may be sufficient as long as the cast can be spread and held open with
                        commercially available plastic cast wedges.</p>
                    <p>Although splitting casts is the traditional means of relieving cast tightness and allowing for
                        swelling, use of thick foam is gaining acceptance at many centers (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-10</span>). Half-inch
                        sterile foam can be used on most postoperative casts when concern for swelling is present.
                        The foam is placed directly on skin to ensure circumferential pressure is not caused by cast
                        padding. Stockinette and cast padding are then applied, followed by fiberglass. This type of
                        cast is not used to hold a closed reduction with cast molding, but works well for fractures
                        made stable with internal fixation.</p>

                    <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 3-10</span> A, B: Foam padding is placed on skin, followed by cast padding, then fiberglass

                        reduction. Ideally, stockinette at the ends of the cast would make for better edges.

                <h2 id="3.3.6">Cast Removal</h2>
                    <p>Casts are removed using an oscillating cast saw designed to cut the hard cast material and not
                        soft material such as padding or skin. In one report, the incidence of cast saw burns occurring
                        with the removal of casting material was found to be 0.72% (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-11</span>).<sup>3</sup> Studies have shown
                        that increased cast thickness, decreased padding, and dull blade use result in higher blade
                        temperatures.<sup>41</sup> The technician who removes the cast must be well trained in the use of the
                        saws. One common pitfall is to slide the oscillating saw along the cast thus increasing the
                        chance of a cut or burn. Proper technique dictates that the blade be used by alternating firm
                        pressure with relaxation into the material and then withdrawn before replacing it at a
                        different location.<sup>66</sup> Furthermore, the technician should intermittently feel the blade and
                        pause during the removal process when necessary to allow the blade to cool.</p>

                    <p>Various safety shields are available; which, at the time of cast removal may be slid between
                        the skin and the padding to prevent saw injury. Oftentimes, the safety shield cannot be slid
                        up the entirety of the cast, so extreme care must be taken in these areas where the skin is not
                        protected. Alternatively, safety strips may be incorporated into the cast at the time of cast
                        application (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-12</span>). Finally, new advances in differing types of saws may improve the
                        safety of cast removal.</p>

                <h2 id="3.3.7">Cast Wedging</h2>
                    <p>In a fresh fracture (usually less than 2 weeks old and prior to significant callus formation) in
                        which initial reduction was obtained and subsequently is found to have an unacceptable loss
                        of reduction, cast wedging of a well-fitting cast may be attempted. Many techniques for cast
                        wedging have been described; however, the most recent description by Bebbington<sup>6</sup> appears
                        to be easy to apply for simple angular deformities. The radiograph of the malaligned limb is
                        used to trace the long axis of the bone onto a sheet of paper, which is then cut along this line.
                        The cut edge of the paper is traced onto the cast, matching the position of the apex of the
                        paper with the apex of the deformity. The cast is then cut, nearly circumferentially at this
                        level, leaving a bridge of intact plaster only at the apex. Corks or cast wedges are applied
                        opposite this bridge, until the line transferred on the cast is straight.</p>
                    <p>If this fails, the cast may need to be removed and the fracture either remanipulated or treated
                        in some other fashion. Great care should be taken when performing cast wedging, especially
                        in the tibia and in fractures where the patient may be already partially healed. The clinician
                        needs to ensure that no excessive focal pressure is exerted at the bridge causing a pressure
                        ulcer or nerve compression. Performing a “closing wedge” of a cast allows the bridge to be
                        placed on the opposite side of the limb, which may be advantageous in certain circumstances,
                        such as correcting a procurvatum or valgus deformity of the tibia. A disadvantage is that it
                        may pinch soft tissue. After performing a cast wedging, it is wise to observe the patient in the
                        clinic long enough to reasonably ensure that any pain associated with the correction has
                        abated and no pain because of focal pressure exists. If any concern exists, a new cast should
                        be applied or a different treatment course taken.</p>
                <h2 id="3.3.8">Casting Over Surgical Wounds and Implants</h2>
                    <p>Often, casts are applied over surgical wounds. While the majority of these heal uneventfully,
                        special attention should be given to casts applied over traumatic or surgical wounds. When
                        applying a stockinette over a surgical wound, care should be taken to ensure the dressing is
                        not bunched up under the liner. It is vitally important that wounds should not be dressed with
                        circumferential cotton gauze as they may become constrictive with dried blood over time and
                        act as a tourniquet. We prefer to use sterile cast padding, which is able to stretch with
                        swelling and we limit placement of the gauze to directly over the wound itself. Applying
                        nonstick dressings directly to the wound aids in decreasing the anxiety of wound inspection
                        during the cast removal process. Should unexplained pain, fevers, foul odors, drainage, or
                        worsening pain occur; wounds should be inspected; however without these, routine
                        inspection is not often necessary.</p>
                    <p>Bending the exposed ends of pins under a cast prevents excessive migration and allows for
                        easy removal; however, migration of the bent end of the pin can occur. Sterile felt or
                        antibiotic dressing may be placed at the pin site to help provide mechanical protection of soft
                        tissue from migrating pins. Be aware that pin caps may become displaced and cause pressure
                        sores. Cast padding should be placed over the pins to prevent them from sticking to the
                        casting material as it hardens.</p>
                    <p>Although the technique of pins and plaster has largely disappeared from adult orthopedics, it
                        can be used occasionally in pediatric orthopedics. In this technique, a fracture is reduced
                        using pins that are placed percutaneously and incorporated into a cast to act essentially as an
                        external fixator. The pin sites should be managed as any other exposed pin with an antibiotic
                        dressing and/or sterile felt at the pin/skin interface. This technique allows the pins to be
                        removed when callus formation is observed without removing the entire cast.</p>
                    <p>To inspect any area of concern under a cast, the cast can be removed, split, or windowed.
                        The process of windowing involves localizing the area of concern and removing the
                        overlying cast in this area without disrupting the alignment of the underlying bone. One may
                        consider removing this window as a circular or oval piece to avoid creating any stress risers
                        in the cast that may alter its structural integrity. However, attempting to cut “curves” with an
                        oscillating saw places torque on the blade, increasing blade temperature. These factors
                        should be remembered when windowing a cast. Once the cast and padding materials are
                        removed, the wound can be inspected. Once satisfied, equal depth of padding should be
                        replaced over the wound and the window replaced. It may be taped in place if serial
                        examinations are required or it may be overwrapped with casting tape. Failure to replace the
                        window can lead to swelling through the window aperture.</p>
                <h2 id="3.3.9">Medical Comorbidities That Affect Cast Care</h2>
                    <p>Even with application of a “perfect” cast, numerous medical issues may complicate tolerance
                        of casting or lead to complications.<sup>37</sup> Children with myelomeningocele are susceptible to a
                        number of casting complications. Pressure sores commonly occur in insensate children who
                        do not experience or exhibit discomfort when irritation arises under the cast. Caution should
                        be taken to avoid areas of increased pressure or overmolding when casting. In addition, the
                        many fractures in children with myelomeningocele result from casting used for
                        immobilization following elective surgery.<sup>51</sup> Iatrogenic fracture risk can be minimized by
                        utilizing casting for as short a time frame as possible and/or use of a soft fiberglass casting
                        material or a soft, bulky dressing that creates less of a stress riser on the bone.<sup>51</sup> Children
                        with cerebral palsy are also at increased risk for pressure sores due to poor nutrition and an
                        inability to articulate pain.68 The contractures that likely contributed to the fracture may
                        make casting or splinting difficult.<sup>59</sup> Similar approaches may be considered in children with
                        malnutrition, renal osteodystrophy or other bone fragility disorders. An additional
                        consideration in cases of malnutrition and diminished bone health includes increased
                        duration of fracture healing that may require longer periods of protection to prevent
                        refracture.<sup>25</sup></p>
                    <p>Children with obesity present their own complications. Although there are no studies
                        documenting the outcomes of casting in obese children, studies on surgical treatment have
                        demonstrated complications of refracture, wound infection, and failure of surgical
                        fixation,<sup>48,73</sup> issues that likely have nonoperative correlates. Loss of alignment when adequate
                        molding cannot occur because of increased soft tissues can occur. When casting an obese
                        child, inclusion of an extra joint above and/or below the fracture may be required to maintain
                        cast position. Diligent monitoring of alignment allows intervention with recasting, wedging,
                        or transition to surgical intervention. Obese patients are more likely to undergo surgical
                        treatment, as opposed to closed reduction, although it is unclear whether this is related to
                        fracture severity or concerns regarding fracture stabilization.<sup>61</sup></p>
                    <p>Alterations in casting materials or approaches may also be necessary in children with
                        behavioral issues. Children with autistic spectrum disorder present additional complexity
                        during cast application (see discussion on distraction techniques), but even prior to cast
                        application considering their behavior guides decision making regarding the most appropriate
                        immobilization. Children with violent tendencies pose even more risk once a cast is applied,
                        not only to others but also to themselves. Administration of behavioral medications may
                        improve tolerance of casting.<sup>16</sup> Soft splinting may be preferable, accepting some risk of
                        malunion over likely secondary injury. Discussion and shared decision making with the
                        parents result in the best management for an individual child and their family.</p>
                    <p>Children with dermatologic conditions require other considerations when deciding on best
                        methods of immobilization. Children with atopic dermatitis may react to synthetic padding,
                        so cotton may be more preferable. Splinting allows for better skin management, but when
                        casting is required, minimizing duration or performing frequent cast changes allows for
                        monitoring of skin conditions or early transition to splinting. Soft casting material contains
                        diisocyanate which has been suspected, but not proven, as a skin irritant in isolated cases<sup>44</sup>;
                        avoiding such material in children with significant skin sensitivity or disorders seems
                        prudent. Windowing the cast over an area of skin breakdown or infection allows for
                        monitoring of the area. Varicella presents an even more complex issue as widespread skin
                        breakdown occurs, predisposing to superinfection and development of bacterial pyomyositis.
                        Casting helps prevent skin breakdown by covering itchy lesions, but monitoring lesions is
                        not possible. Again, splinting may be preferable to allow for monitoring if it does not
                        compromise maintenance of fracture reduction; otherwise, windowing, or frequent cast
                        changes may allow for skin monitoring. There should be a low threshold for removal of the
                        cast if the child complains of pain to assess for not only compartment syndrome or infection,
                        but also necrotizing fasciitis.<sup>22,18</sup></p>

                    <p>Sugar-tong splints provide effective temporary support to the wrist and forearm until
                        definitive reduction and casting or internal fixation, while allowing for swelling. Sugar-tong
                        splints can be used for definitive treatment provided the splint is comfortable and is
                        retightened after 3 to 5 days to accommodate the decrease in swelling. At that point,
                        reapplication of an elastic bandage or overwrapping with fiberglass is appropriate.
                        Before treating, the contralateral uninjured limb may be used as a template to measure and
                        prepare an appropriate slab of casting material which should be wide enough to fully support
                        the volar and dorsal surfaces of the arm (without radial and ulnar overlap) and long enough
                        to span the arm from the volar MP flexion crease in the hand, around the elbow (flexed at 90
                        degrees), and dorsally to the metacarpal heads (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-13</span>). It is important that plaster splints
                        are no more than 10 layers thick and of appropriate length so that edges do not have to be
                        folded over (increasing thickness and the heat from curing). The slab is further customized to
                        cut out material around the thumb base and tuck cuts are made at the elbow to prevent
                        bunching of the material during the application.</p>

                    <p>The injured arm is reduced and positioned as described above, it is wrapped with three to
                        four layers of cotton padding from the hand and around the elbow (similar thickness as that
                        used for long-arm casting). The slab is dipped in cool water, excess water is removed and the
                        material is vigorously rubbed together so that the layers incorporate for strength. The ends of
                        the slab have two to three layers of padding applied which will fold back and make the edges
                        soft (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-14</span>). The splint is applied and held with one roll of cotton and then an elastic
                        bandage is tightly applied until the material is hardened (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-15</span>). After hardening, the
                        tight Ace bandage is removed and replaced with a new elastic bandage applied without
                        significant tension (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-16</span>). This method ensures an optimal fit without having the splint

                    <p>Case study 1: A 7-year-old girl with a both-bone forearm fracture undergoes attempted
                        closed reduction and long-arm cast application. She presents to clinic the following day,
                        where radiographs reveal angulation of 18 degrees in the AP plane and 5 degrees in the
                        lateral plane (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-17</span>). Critical review of this case demonstrates a cast applied with too
                        much padding and thus a poor fit, is too short in the long-arm portion, has too much plaster
                        applied throughout the cast and especially in the antecubital fossa (increased risk for burn),
                        and has a curved ulnar border that allows the arm to settle into the angulation. She is
                        indicated for cast removal and rereduction.</p>

                    <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 3-17</span> A 6-year-old girl with a both-bone forearm fracture.
                        Clinical pictures (A,B) demonstrate a huge cast that does not adequately immobilize the
                        elbow. The fracture has lost reduction (C,D).</p>
                    <p>Fracture reduction and long-arm cast application are best done in a setting where the child is
                        adequately sedated and where enough qualified personnel can apply the cast under
                        fluoroscopic guidance, although this may not be possible in many locations. Fracture
                        reduction technique may consist of longitudinal traction, manipulation recreating the
                        deformity (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-18</span>), or reducing the fracture and placing the intact periosteum on tension.
                        Three-point molding can be used in completely displaced fractures at the same level in the
                        forearm; hand rotation is the final position to account for, based on angulation. In both-bone
                        forearm fractures in which the fractures are at differing levels, apex volar greenstick
                        angulation is reduced with pronation and apex dorsal angulation is reduced with supination.
                        It may be helpful to remember the (literal) “rule of thumb”: rotating the thumb toward the
                        apex of the deformity aids in reduction. Thus, an apex volar greenstick is reduced with
                        pronation, an apex dorsal with supination. Optimal hand and wrist rotations can be ensured
                        with fluoroscopy prior to cast application.</p>

                    <p><span class="figure_num">Figure 3-18</span> The deformity is accentuated and hyperflexion followed by reduction can allow
                        the displaced ends to become opposed.

                    <p>In this instance, longitudinal traction is used with an assistant while a thin layer of cotton
                        padding is applied (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-19</span>). Alternatively, the fingers could be placed in finger traps with
                        the elbow flexed just short of 90 degrees and with weights from the distal humerus.
                        Individual strips of cotton are placed and torn with tension to fit intimately on the posterior
                        elbow thus avoiding too much anterior padding (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-20</span>). Cotton is rolled high in the axilla
                        to ensure enough padding for the proximal trimline (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-21</span>). After padding is applied to
                        the entire arm, a small splint of five layers of Plaster of Paris is fashioned to fit into the first
                        web space (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-22</span>) and then incorporated with sequential layers of plaster (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-23</span>); we
                        find that this method allows for a better fit in the hand. Plaster is pushed and unrolled up the
                        arm to the elbow (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-6</span>) without lifting the plaster roll off the arm unless tucks are
                        needed in the concavity. We prefer to apply Plaster of Paris or fiberglass to a limb in stages
                        by focusing and immobilizing one joint at a time; for long-arm casts, we apply and mold the
                        wrist and forearm and we extend the cast up over the elbow after the material has hardened.
                        Once enough plaster is applied, the initial mold to incorporate the layers is started by rubbing
                        the arm circumferentially (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-24</span>). As the plaster begins to harden, terminal molding of
                        the arm is performed under fluoroscopy by flattening the plaster over the apex of the
                        deformity (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-25</span>), molding the ulnar border with the flat of the hand (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-26</span>), and
                        finally with some interosseus molding (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-27</span>) that will make the cast flatter and less
                        cylindrical in cross section. Fluoroscopy images are obtained as the short-arm portion
                        hardens before extending the cast up the humerus. If acceptable reduction is apparent, the
                        antecubital fossa is inspected closely to detect and trim back cast material which may be too
                        high and which could lead to neurovascular compromise. Decreased pressure in a limb can
                        be obtained by using foam underneath the cast material or by cutting and spreading casts and
                        after releasing the underlying padding. This method of applying the cast in two stages has the
                        potential downside of edges of the short-arm cast digging into soft tissue proximally, so this
                        must be avoided. As the cast is extended up the humerus, a small posterior splint can be
                        applied to elbow convexity to decrease the tendency to fill the concavity of the elbow with
                        thick exothermic plaster. The humerus portion is molded terminally by flattening the
                        posterior humerus and molding along the supracondylar ridges. Plain radiographs are then
                        obtained while the child is still sedated and if alignment is good, the forearm cast is
                        univalved and spread. In general, the cast should be univalved and spread on the side of the
                        arm which is opposite the direction of initial displacement; a fracture with a propensity for
                        dorsal displacement should be split volarly and a fracture with a propensity for volar
                        displacement should be split and spread along the dorsal surface. After 2 weeks, the plain
                        radiographs demonstrate improved reduction and a more improved fitting cast (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-28</span>).</p>

                        centers for displaced both-bone diaphyseal fractures. Alternative methods include the use of
                        fiber glass with the stretch relax technique, which generally does not require splints or
                        univalving. As there are now good quality, randomized prospective studies showing that
                        distal third both-bone fractures are treated equally well in short- or long-arm casts, short-arm
                        cast immobilization is appropriate for most distal radius and ulnar fractures. The technique of
                        application is similar to that presented above; however, it is important that the distal cast be
                        oval in cross section (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-27</span>) and the cast index (ratio of the AP cast width to lateral
                        cast depth) to be near 0.7.</p>

                    <p>Case study 2: A 6-year-old boy suffers a displaced both-bone forearm fracture that is treated
                        with long-arm cast application. Proximal and middle third both-bone forearm fractures are
                        harder to manage as there is less remodeling potential; further, when the radius is fractured
                        proximal to the ulna, one can often see more difficulty in holding the fractures reduced when
                        the elbow is flexed. At 1 week, radiographs demonstrate loss in reduction with 30 degrees of
                        angulation at the radius and the need for rereduction (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-29</span>).</p>

                        The radius fracture is proximal to the ulna and this pattern is prone to loss of reduction in a

                    <p>In this instance, we plan to reduce the arm with a combination of traction, pronation, and
                        apex pressure with fluoroscopic guidance (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-30</span>). Once reduced, the arm is held with
                        longitudinal traction, proximal and distal stockinette and cotton padding are applied for a
                        long arm-thumb spica cast in extension (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-31</span>). Including the thumb in this cast will
                        fully control forearm rotation while additionally maintaining the fracture out-to-length,
                        which is obtained during the casting under traction. To prevent pressure sores over the
                        thumb, extra padding is placed over the radial aspect of the anatomic snuff-box and thumb.
                        The thumb spica portion of fiberglass is placed carefully out to the tip of the thumb while
                        holding the thumb in neutral abduction and opposition (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-32</span>). The fiberglass is applied
                        with 50% overlap and using the stretch relaxation technique, fluoroscopy is again utilized
                        while terminal molding of the short-arm portion is performed in slight pronation and with
                        broad pressure over the apex of the deformity (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-33</span>). The upper arm portion is next
                        applied once the forearm portion is hardened and with the reduction confirmed under
                        fluoroscopic imaging. As the upper fiberglass hardens, a supracondylar mold is applied with
                        the arm in gentle traction as the butt of the surgeon's hand and thenar eminence terminally
                        mold the fiberglass (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-34</span>); this mold in concert with the thumb spica mold should help
                        to maintain rotation and length of the reduction. Final trimming and finishing the edges with
                        the previously placed stockinette is done in the hand and the palmar trimline is cut back to
                        allow MP finger flexion (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-35</span>). Finally, the dorsum of the cast can be univalved with a
                        cast saw to allow for swelling; with fiberglass the cut edges of the cast need to be held open
                        with commercially available spacers (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-36</span>) or other such material to keep the cast from
                        springing closed; this is in contradistinction to plaster which can remain open once a
                        terminally molded cast is spread. Plain radiographs after 3 weeks of immobilization confirm
                        reduction of the fracture (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-37</span>).</p>

                    <p>Usual incorporation of the thumb is needed for the extension cast described above as well as
                        carpal injuries. Some surgeons include the thumb in all short-arm casts too. Regardless, it's
                        important to ensure the thumb is well padded and casted in a neutral position thumb
                        abduction and opposition with well-padded distal trimline.</p>
                <h2 id="3.4.6">Shoulder Immobilization<img src="./images/ic_fluent_video_clip_24_filled.svg" alt="" style="left:50px;"></h2>
                    <p>Immobilization about the shoulder and the clavicle is somewhat limited when compared with
                        other areas of the skeleton. Because of anatomic constraints about the shoulder, it is often
                        very challenging to gain a reduction of a bone (proximal humerus, clavicle); and it is not
                        practical to expect the fracture fragment to be firmly held in a reduced position. One
                        historical exception may be the use of the shoulder spica cast for displaced proximal humerus
                        fractures. Practically speaking, this cast was challenging to apply and for the patient to wear;
                        pediatric orthopedic trauma surgeons today would use internal fixation to maintain fracture
                        reduction.</p>
                    <p>Despite the difficulty encountered when attempting reduction and firmly maintaining
                        reduction with closed means, immobilization about the shoulder is used to provide comfort in
                        the injured child. For clavicle fractures, a figure-of-eight collar or a shoulder sling can
                        support the shoulder. Although the figure-of-eight collar was designed to retract the shoulder
                        posteriorly and thus potentially reduce a shortened clavicle; practically the effect is minimal
                        and the force needed to hold the shoulder back is often a challenge to the patient. Most
                        patients find a personal preference between figure-of-eight collar and shoulder sling which is
                        acceptable given equal clinical results between the two.</p>
                    <p>A proximal humerus fracture (whether treated nonoperatively or operatively) may be
                        protected with immobilization with a sugar-tong splint. This splint is applied in stages. A
                        slab of fiberglass or plaster is cut to a length that spans the proximal medial humerus (not too
                        high in the axilla) and extends over the elbow and up the lateral aspect of the humerus up
                        over the shoulder (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-38</span>). After dipping in water, the slab is placed on appropriate
                        padding and then applied to the arm. We find it helpful to wrap sugar-tong splints very
                        tightly with an elastic bandage as this improves the mold and fit. The elastic bandage is
                        removed when the splint material is hard and is replaced loosely with a new one. The
                        common pitfalls with this type of immobilization include the medial splint edge in the axilla
                        that is too thick or too high. In addition, when the lateral splint edge is too low and ends
                        close to a fracture level, it does not immobilize and actually increases the lever arm forces at
                        the fracture. This is due to the fact that the adjacent joints which are immobilized, and that
                        could normally move and decrease the length of the lever arm, cannot function as such.</p>

                    <p>Hanging arm casts can be used in proximal humerus surgical neck fractures and humeral
                        shaft fractures. These synthetic long-arm casts are applied with the concept that gravity will
                        act upon the humerus fracture and can be effective in gradually improving alignment in
                        children with fractures that are minimally angulated or bayonet opposed. The children will
                        have to sleep in an upright position for several weeks until the fracture is healed enough to be
                        converted to splint immobilization. These casts are simple long-arm casts that do not require
                        intimate molding; the weight of the cast will provide gradual distraction that aligns the
                        fracture. Common pitfalls include a patient who cannot sleep upright and placing the neck
                        collar attachment on the forearm too close to the elbow, which could increase anterior
                        angulation; or placing the attachment too close to the wrist, which could lead to posterior
                        angulation.</p>
                <h2 id="3.4.7">Short-Leg Cast Application<img src="./images/ic_fluent_video_clip_24_filled.svg" alt="" style="left:50px;"></h2>
                    <p>Short-leg casts are applied with goals of fully immobilizing the lower leg and keeping the
                        ankle at 90 degrees while avoiding complications such as pressure sores. After applying
                        proximal and distal stockinette, the limb is wrapped with cotton padding and the ankle is held
                        at 90 degrees. A potential pitfall is that as the casting material is placed, the ankle drifts into
                        equinus; then as ankle flexion is restored to 90 degrees, casting material bunches up at the
                        anterior ankle, which can cause soft tissue damage over time as well as neurovascular
                        constriction. To avoid excessive Plaster of Paris cast material over the anterior ankle, a
                        posterior splint of five layers thick is measured and applied (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-39</span>) and then overwrapped
                        with plaster rolls (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-40</span>). The ankle can be held at 90 degrees by the surgeon's torso and
                        the plaster is carefully molded around the malleoli and the pretibial crest (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-7</span>). The
                        cast should be hard and well cured before cutting; bivalving a wet cast will weaken it and the
                        foot can drift into equinus. The cooled cast can be supported on a pillow with the ankle
                        hanging free (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-8</span>). Once hardened, the cast can be univalved and spread anteriorly,
                        if needed, to accommodate swelling; if significant swelling is expected, then the cast can be
                        bivalved and spread with release of the cotton padding. Using fiberglass for short-leg casts
                        generally results in a lighter and stronger cast, but if fiberglass is improperly applied too
                        tightly, it can cause compartment syndrome.</p>

                    <p>Long-leg cast application incorporates all of the techniques above; once the short-leg portion
                        has hardened, the upper thigh is wrapped with padding and the knee (held in the chosen
                        degree of flexion) and thigh are overwrapped with cast material. Care is needed to make sure
                        the posterior trimline of the short-leg cast is not too high and which could be compressing in
                        the popliteal fossa. The anterior knee portion can be reinforced with a splint and thus further
                        decreasing the cast load in the popliteal fossa. Finally, a medial and lateral supracondylar
                        mold (similar to that in long-arm cast) can be used to support the weight of the cast and
                        prevent distal migration. Plaster long-leg casts can be heavy, as such we will use an all
                        fiberglass cast or consider a composite cast whereby the short-leg portion is molded with
                        Plaster of Paris and then when hardened, the proximal portion is placed with fiberglass.</p>
                <h2 id="3.4.9">Short-Leg Splint Application<img src="./images/ic_fluent_video_clip_24_filled.svg" alt="" style="left:50px;"></h2>
                    <p>Posterior short-leg splints are commonly used to immobilize the foot and ankle prior to
                        definitive operative or nonoperative treatment and additionally to support the limb in the
                        immediate postoperative period. These splints can accommodate significant swelling
                        following trauma or surgery. Supplemental stirrup application may be needed in larger
                        patients whose foot position cannot be controlled with a single posterior slab. In these cases,
                        similar application methods and principles are used as seen in the upper extremity sugar-tong
                        splint application.</p>
                    <p>Fundamental application includes holding the foot and ankle in 90 degrees of flexion while
                        the limb is wrapped with four to six layers of cotton padding from the toes to the knee. A
                        posterior slab of plaster is selected and should be wide enough to provide a medial and lateral
                        trimline of an inch. It should be 10 layers thick and measured similarly to that seen in shortleg
                        cast application described above. If needed, a U-stirrup of plaster five layers thick is
                        measured and is usually 1 to 2 in narrower than the posterior plaster slab; this allows overlap
                        of the two pieces of plaster without completely covering the anterior foot, ankle, and leg.
                        Both the stirrup and the posterior slab are dipped in water and the proximal and distal
                        trimlines are padded with three to four more layers of cast padding. The slab is applied
                        posteriorly; any redundant material at the level of the heel can be cut away before the Ustirrup
                        is applied with some overlap of the stirrup and the slab. The plaster is held in place
                        with one layer of cast padding. An elastic bandage is applied tightly until the plaster is hard,
                        and then removed to prevent constriction. This last layer of cast padding allows for easy
                        removal of the final layer of loosely applied elastic bandage or self-adherent elastic tape.
                        Variances to this method are similar to sugar-tong splint application described above. For
                        instance, some practitioners prefer to layer the wet plaster splint with 5 thicknesses of
                        padding and apply the padded splint directly to the limb. This has advantages in minimizing
                        circumferential wrapping of the limb with cotton; yet great care is needed to prevent
                        inadvertent bunching or slipping of the padding.</p>
                <h2 id="3.4.10">Spica Cast Application<img src="./images/ic_fluent_video_clip_24_filled.svg" alt="" style="left:50px;"></h2>
                    <p>Spica casts can be applied from infants to adolescents and the location of application can
                        vary according to age and clinical problem. For instance, infants and most children with
                        painful injuries will require sedation and application in the supine position on a spica table.
                        In contrast, a single-leg spica cast can be used as an adjunct to internal fixation for femur
                        fracture in large children or adolescents. These latter casts can be applied in a supine or even
                        a standing position with a compliant and comfortable patient. Because of the size of the
                        casts, most spica casts are constructed with synthetic cast material; Plaster of Paris still has
                        utility in small infants where a more intimate mold is used and where it's hard to conform
                        fiberglass rolls.</p>
                    <p>Spica cast application in children is performed on a well-padded spica table which should be
                        firmly attached to the OR bed or cart; one person should be responsible for managing the
                        torso and making sure the child does not fall off the table; one to two assistants will support
                        the legs while the anesthesia team manages the head and airway—this leaves the last of a
                        four- or five-person team to apply the cast.</p>
                    <p>Before placing the child on the spica table, a waterproof pantaloon or stockinette is applied to
                        the torso and legs in some centers. Place a 2- to 4-in thick towel or other pad on the stomach
                        and under the liner or stockinette that will be removed when the cast is dry, to have room for
                        food and respiration. Note that if the patient starts to desaturate during spica cast application,
                        pulling out the abdomen padding frequently resolves this. The child is lifted onto the table
                        and 3 to 6 thicknesses of padding are applied, with more at bony prominences such as over
                        the patella and heels. It is also wise to completely cover the perineum with padding and high
                        over the thorax; it is extremely hard to add padding once the cast material is applied (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-
                        41</span>). After padding is appropriately applied, the thorax is wrapped with synthetic cast
                        material (see <span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-9</span>) and extended down over the uninjured thigh; care is needed to cover
                        the “intern's triangle”; this is the posterior area of the cast at the junction of the thigh,
                        buttock, and thorax. Once the uninjured leg portion is hardened, the injured leg is casted
                        from proximal to distal. We recommend casting from the thorax, over the hip, and to the
                        distal thigh then extending over the knee and onto the distal leg as soon as the hip and thigh
                        portion is firm; once the knee and leg portion is hardened, then extend it down to include the
                        foot and ankle. Care must be taken not to apply a short-leg cast first, and use it to apply
                        traction across the femur as this is associated with soft tissue problems and compartment
                        syndrome. In general, we include the foot in neuromuscular patients who are prone to
                        develop an equinus contracture and whose distal tibia is osteoporotic and prone to fracture at
                        the level of the distal trimline. The risk of including the foot in a spica cast is soft tissue
                        problems over the dorsal ankle. Once the final cast is hardened, the perineal region is
                        trimmed out and patient is removed from the spica table. The abdominal pad is removed and
                        in some children, a hole can be cut for further room (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-42</span>). Next, appropriate
                        radiographs are obtained and the trimlines are padded from rolling back the under padding
                        and lining and incorporated with trim fiberglass. The decision to apply a bar from leg to leg
                        is made based on the structural integrity of the cast. Usually, this is not needed in small
                        children and infants. Should a bar be needed, then it is wise to wait until the cast is fully
                        cured and the chance of a pressure sore is decreased. Non-toilet-trained infants and children
                        need to have an absorbent pad (small diaper, ABD pad, or sanitary napkin) placed in the
                        perineal region and then a diaper is placed over this (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 3-43</span>). Simply placing a diaper over
                        the cast will not absorb the waste material, as the diaper will not be in contact before it tracks
                        under the cast.</p>

                    <p>For length-stable diaphyseal femoral shaft fractures, many centers are now moving toward a
                        single-leg spica cast, which does not include the contralateral thigh and positions the hip and
                        knee in less flexion and gives the child the opportunity to ambulate with a walker or
                        crutches.</p>
            <h1 id="3.5">CONCLUSION</h1>
                <p>In this chapter, we highlight the pearls and pitfalls of cast and splint application in children
                    with pediatric orthopedic trauma. This orthopedic subspecialty is one of the few in which an
                    injury is more likely treated with these methods than surgical treatment. A dearth of
                    prospective studies means that much art and personal preferences remain in cast and splint
                    application. As time moves along and there are more innovative methods to treat fractures
                    with surgery, the role of casting will not be supplanted. There will always be a need for a
                    technically well-done cast that helps speed recovery in pediatric trauma. In our minds, the
                    many complications result from inappropriate use of the cast or splint to obtaincorrection; in
                    contrast, the cast or splint should be used to maintain reduction achieved either open or
                    closed. Tight casts and bandages are also commonly associated with compartment syndrome.
                    Problems such as tight casts, wet casts leading to infection, foreign objects in casts, and
                    pressure ulcers are not uncommon. It is important to educate parents that small children may
                    not adequately communicate problems occurring under a cast. It is good for us all to
                    remember that in the words of Chad Price, MD, “there are no hypochondriacs in a cast.”</p>
