            <h1 id="12.1">INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>To the uninitiated, pediatric elbow fractures can be difficult to properly diagnose. The
                    absence of ossification in the young, the vagaries of secondary centers of ossification, and
                    the limits of plain radiographs in the skeletally immature all contribute to risk of
                    misdiagnosis, improper management, and poor outcome in some patients. Since most of
                    these children present with their injuries initially to urgent care and emergency care units that
                    may not have experienced pediatric orthopedic surgeons and radiologists on site, the risk
                    magnifies. Even for experienced caregivers, a select group of injuries, the correct diagnosis,
                    and thus management can be elusive. At the end of the 19th century, Sir Robert
                    Jones<sup>30</sup> echoed the opinion of that era about elbow injuries: "The difficulties experienced by
                    surgeons in making an accurate diagnosis; the facility with which serious blunders can be
                    made in prognosis and treatment; and the fear shared by so many of the subsequent
                    limitations of function, serve to render injuries in the neighborhood of the elbow less
                    attractive than they might otherwise have proved." These concerns are applicable even today.
                    The importance of correct diagnosis was emphasized in a study of litigation against the
                    National Health Service in England: Over half of the cases involved missed or incorrectly
                    diagnosed injuries, most of which were fractures about the elbow.<sup>4</sup> The difficulty in correctly
                    diagnosing elbow injuries in children was shown by Shrader et al., who found that
                    emergency room physicians accurately diagnosed elbow fractures in children only 53% of
                    the time.<sup>57</sup> On the other hand, diagnostic errors with overcalls (1.1%) and miss rate (1.6%) of
                    1, 235 abnormal cases and 2,630 normal cases were reported by Bisset and Crowe when
                    senior certificate of added qualification pediatric radiologists read the films.<sup>9</sup></p>
                <p>In other bones and joints, good results can often be obtained with minimal treatment, but in
                    the elbow, more aggressive diagnostic testing and surgical treatment are often required to
                    avoid complications. This was emphasized in paper and text by Waters et al., on <b>TRASH</b>
                    (<b>T</b>he <b>R</b>adiographic <b>A</b>ppearance <b>S</b>eemed <b>H</b>armless) lesions of the pediatric elbow.<sup>68,69</sup> An
                    understanding of the basic anatomy and radiographic landmarks of the elbow is essential in
                    choosing appropriate treatment.</p>
            <h1 id="12.2">EPIDEMIOLOGY</h1>
                <p>Because children tend to protect themselves with their outstretched arms when they fall, 
                    upper extremity fractures account for 65% to 75% of all fractures in children. 
                    The most common area of the upper extremity injured is the distal forearm.<sup>5,36</sup>
                    Ten to twelve percent of all pediatric fractures involve the elbow but the highest 
                    complication rate of upper extremity fractures involve the elbow.</p>
                <p>The distal humerus accounts for approximately 86% of fractures about the elbow region.
                    Supracondylar fractures are the most frequent elbow injuries in children, reported to occur in
                    55% to 75% of patients with elbow fractures. Lateral condylar and radial neck are the second
                    most common fractures,<sup>26</sup> followed by medial epicondylar fractures. Fractures of the radial
                    head, medial condyle, and T-condylar fractures are much less common. Olecranon fractures
                    can be occult initially and seen more commonly on follow-up than original x-rays.<sup>26</sup></p>
                <p>The peak age for fractures of the distal humerus is between 5 and 10 years old.<sup>28</sup></p>
                <p>Physeal injuries in most parts of the body occur in older children between the ages of 10 and
                    13; however, the peak age for injuries to the distal humeral physes is 4 to 5 years in girls and
                    5 to 8 years in boys.</p>
                <p>Finally, patient-specific carrying angle can predispose to fracture type with injury. Elbow
                    alignment may influence the transmission of traumatic force with a fall on an outstretched
                    arm with varus alignment more commonly resulting in lateral condyle fractures and valgus
                    alignment more commonly with radial neck fractures.</p>
            <h1 id="12.3">ANATOMY</h1>
                <p>The elbow is a complex joint composed of three individual joints contained within a common
                    articular cavity. Several anatomic concepts are unique to the growing elbow.</p>

                                <h3>Distal Humerus</h3>
                                    <p>Ossification of the distal humerus proceeds at a predictable rate. In general, the rate of
                                        ossification in girls exceeds that of boys.<sup>20,21,24</sup> In some areas, such as the olecranon and
                                        lateral epicondyle, the difference between boys and girls in ossification age may be as great
                                        as 2 years.<sup>20</sup> During the first 6 months, the ossification border of the distal humerus is
                                        symmetric (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 12-1</span>).</p>

                                        is fairly symmetric.
                                        Later, the lateral column becomes more vertical compared to the relatively more horizontal
                                        medial column on AP views.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Lateral Condyle</h3>
                                    <p>On average, the ossification center of the lateral condyle appears just before 1 year of age but
                                        may be delayed as late as 18 to 24 months.<sup>11</sup> When the nucleus of the lateral condyle first
                                        appears, the distal humeral metaphyseal border becomes asymmetric. The lateral border
                                        slants and becomes straight to conform with the ossification center of the lateral condyle
                                        (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 12-2</span>). By the end of the second year, this border becomes well defined, possibly even
                                        slightly concave. The capitellar ossification center is usually spherical when it first appears.
                                        It becomes more hemispherical as the distal humerus matures,<sup>10</sup> and the ossific nucleus
                                        extends into the lateral ridge of the trochlea (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 12-3</span>). On the lateral view, the physis of the
                                        capitellum is wider posteriorly. This is a normal variation and should not be confused with a
                                        fracture.<sup>10</sup></p>

                                        As the ossification center of the lateral condyle develops (arrow), the lateral border of the
                                        metaphysis becomes straighter. The initial ossification is usually elliptical and often appears
                                        fragmented, not to be confused with fracture.</p>

                                        condyle extends into the lateral crista of the trochlea.
                                        The lateral border of the neck (metaphysis) of the radius is normally angulated both
                                        anteriorly and laterally. The secondary center of ossification of the radial head is usually not
                                        yet present.</p>
                                <h3>Medial Epicondyle</h3>
                                    <p>At about 5 to 6 years of age, a small concavity develops on the medial aspect of the
                                        metaphyseal ossification border. In this area, a medial epicondyle begins to ossify (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 12-
                                        4</span>).</p>

                                        At this same time, the ossification center of the radial head also develops (open arrow). Note
                                        that the physis of the proximal radius is widened laterally (curved arrow). Again, none of
                                        these findings should be viewed as fracture related.</p>
                                <h3>Trochlea</h3>
                                    <p>At about 9 to 10 years of age, the trochlea begins to ossify. Initially, it may be irregular with
                                        multiple centers (<span class="figure_num">Fig. 12-5</span>).</p>

                                may begin as two well-defined centers (arrows). These multiple centers can give the trochlea
                                a fragmented appearance. This is not to be confused with avascular necrosis of the trochlea.
                                Also, remember what the trochlea ossification center normally looks like so an entrapped
                                medial epicondyle (B) will not be mistaken for normal ossification. Anteroposterior
                                radiographs after a closed reduction. Note the entrapment of the medial epicondyle in the

                                    of age, it may begin as a small, separate oblong center, rapidly fusing with the lateral
